1,City of Fort Worth fast-tracks free Wi-Fi access in under-connected areas,Cyndi Barrera,"b'We are delighted to have Cyndi Barrera, Sales Vice President for State, Local, and Education (SLED) West at Presidio as guest blogger on our channel.\nThink about your daily patterns at home. Turn on the light switch, pour a drink of water, grab your phone. Using that phone you\xe2\x80\x99ll check the news, do some shopping, and pay a few bills online. The internet access you rely on every day is vital for telehealth, job market information and educational opportunities.\nThe transition to the internet of everything is great unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the millions of people in the US living in under-connected communities without easy access to online connectivity.\nA lack of internet access is now a considerable disadvantage. Kids who are unable to get online at home are more likely to have difficulty in school and risk getting lower grades. And most job postings and public information is found online these days, with much of it online only. During the pandemic, access to Wi-Fi was a clear lifeline. And in recent years, more and more routine processes have become fully digital.\nAn achievable solution\nThe City of Fort Worth, Texas has a trailblazing history of innovation and is in the early stages of its strategic plan to provide fiber connections to all residents. But that ground-breaking five-year commitment is still years away from completion. There are neighborhoods in the City that struggle to access affordable and reliable internet connectivity.\nThe City decided it would take action to bridge this digital divide by providing free public Wi-Fi to the most affected neighborhoods.\nOur team at Presidio partnered with Cisco to develop a plan and design a solution that could quickly respond to this critical need. Given that the city was able to leverage federal funding, we were able to put together an achievable solution to provide Wi-Fi to residents of five targeted neighborhoods, and do so in just weeks.\nTechnology to meet the challenge\nThe project design was in progress in just two weeks. Equipment was being ordered within a couple of months. The solution would include Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul radios (Cisco URWB), Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3300 Rugged Series switches, and Cisco Meraki MR86 access points, which were placed strategically across the neighborhoods on poles or outside public buildings. With this approach, the City was able to provide essential Wi-Fi coverage to the most under-connected areas during the multi-year deployment of city-wide fiber. It would cost less than half of fiber, and be ready to go much sooner.\nAs part of the project, Presidio worked out where equipment should be placed to ensure the best possible coverage, while avoiding signal interference from trees and other obstacles. The Presidio team also supported the deployment and fixed issues along the way, which was challenging at times to work around weather conditions.\nThe rewards of digital equality\nSo far, the City provides free public Wi-Fi access to 40,000 people in 10,000 households, with another 5,000 households due to come online very soon. The Cisco URWB Radios enable the Wi-Fi service for users as \xe2\x80\x98set it and forget it.\xe2\x80\x99 And with Cisco Umbrella security filtering content, even the youngest residents in the area will find safe internet browsing.\nCisco Cloud management solutions help provide easy network management and any interruptions, such as service outages, are flagged immediately. This kind of simplicity is a real advantage for the City. And when the fiber roll-out is complete, the technology will continue to ensure that Fort Worth has a future-ready environment for years to come.\nLearn more\nRead Written Case Study\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nCisco Industrial Ethernet 3300 Rugged Series Switches\nCisco Umbrella Web Content Filtering\n<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_end"">\xef\xbb\xbf</span>\nCyndi Barrera has over 20 years of experience in digital, data and technology-based roles.

2,"Secure Equipment Access: more uptime, fewer truck rolls, remote access control",Angela Murphy,"b'It was a pleasure to connect with so many customers and partners at Cisco Live EMEA in Amsterdam last month. We were excited to announce several innovations \xe2\x80\x93 including new services in cloud-based Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. These innovations are game changing for industrial organizations seeking to accelerate their digital transformation, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer experiences. Our announcements included:\nEnhanced Secure Equipment Access (SEA) service increases flexibility for the remote management and maintenance of industrial assets.\nNew Cisco Cyber Vision service provides visibility into the security posture of industrial networks.\nNew industrial wireless service supports our industrial wireless series devices when operating in Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul.\nIn this blog we will discuss how organizations can maintain remote connected assets at scale with Secure Equipment Access in IoT Operations Dashboard.\nMany industrial organizations need to manage equipment in very diverse locations in order to gain the full benefits of digitization. This is top of mind for our customers and partners. Their operations are spread across entire regions and different countries. And the equipment they\xe2\x80\x99re deploying likely comes from a variety of manufacturers and may have been installed at different times. Industrial equipment \xe2\x80\x93 from roadside cameras and LiDAR cameras to signaling systems and more \xe2\x80\x93 frequently requires specialized technical support from their respective manufacturers for upgrades and troubleshooting.\nAs the number of assets grows complexity increases. Onsite network and equipment maintenance often require significant resources: the time it takes to travel to site and identify which assets need an upgrade plus the costs of getting to those sites. More time and expense are required to secure the specialized resources who can handle the upgrade or resolve an outage.\nProviding connectivity to industrial assets in remote locations is the first step for digitizing industrial environments. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT portfolio provides the support required to connect industrial assets using fixed, wireless, and cellular access. And IoT Operations Dashboard, a cloud-based platform of OT services, enables the deployment and management of Cisco industrial routers and now industrial wireless backhaul.\nHowever, as more assets are connected, customers need control over how internal and external workers are accessing these assets. Many of our discussions with customers are about the need for more control over their remote access capabilities. In many cases vendors may be using different methods of access, without customer oversight or control. For more on why this matters, check out this blog on the Oldsmar Cyber Attack.\nWith the newly enhanced SEA service in IoT Operations Dashboard, it now becomes possible to securely handle configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities for assets connected to industrial routers remotely. In other words, what used to incur significant expense and time can now be completed without a site visit, and with visibility and control! Customers love the fact that SEA can provide centralized remote access for their vendors \xe2\x80\x93 under their own control! And with enterprise grade security controls, for example Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign On (SSO) including Active Directory (AD) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n  How it works\nSEA provides a single service that enterprise IT network managers can use to enable their operational technology (OT) experts to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot assets on the industrial network easily and securely.\nOT workers can set parameters to define which internal and external teams can access which assets, when and for what purpose:\nWhen a device on an offshore wind farm stops working, it becomes possible to diagnose \xe2\x80\x93 and even fix \xe2\x80\x93 the issue remotely.\nWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s an upgrade that affects connected cameras across a massive bus fleet, the camera manufacturer can implement the upgrade remotely \xe2\x80\x93 without technicians physically boarding every vehicle.\nWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to configure equipment at the roadside or at roadway intersections, those configurations can be set up and orchestrated remotely. The same is true of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 even when charging stations span multiple locations across a wide geographic area.\nThese activities can be carried out using just a web browser or a user application on the workstation through a direct connection to the industrial asset. Configuration files can be downloaded, and log files collected, easily. Customers are seeing the benefits: They save thousands of dollars per site in truck rolls and can easily control and oversee the access to connected industrial assets.\nIn short, SEA in Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard simplifies remote operations for anyone who manages equipment at the roadside or roadway intersections, on solar or wind farms, at EV charging infrastructure or across mass transit systems, for example. It dramatically simplifies and streamlines secure maintenance of connected assets while offering the flexibility, security, and scalability of a cloud-based platform.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a closer look at this service in our upcoming webinar, \xe2\x80\x98How do you enable operations team to centrally manage remote access to industrial assets securely and at scale?\xe2\x80\x99 on March 23. Register today \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the first step to faster, simpler industrial IoT asset maintenance.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Secure Equipment Access Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Fleet Connected Roadways Industrial IoT (IIoT) Transportation,"March 9, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520194112-angemurp-1-150x150.png
3,Connecting industrial devices anywhere with Cisco’s new modules for LoRaWAN and 450MHz LTE,Emily Kasman,"b'Extending connectivity to remote sites can be challenging, especially when connectivity requirements differ depending on location and use case. As organizations are automating and establishing remote operations, Cisco is expanding the capabilities of the Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router to meet the connectivity requirements of businesses wherever they operate.\nAt Mobile World Congress in February of 2023, we announced two pluggable interface modules (PIM) for the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers: one for long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) connectivity and one for 450MHz private LTE connectivity.\nA modular router to meet your connectivity needs\nWireless networking technologies are constantly evolving. The Cisco Catalyst IR1101 is a modular router that supports a variety of backhaul technologies to meet your exact needs: Ethernet and xDSL as well as many different 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G radio bands and categories. Pluggable modules can be easily swapped to adapt to changes and avoid costly rip-and-replace upgrades, especially as 2G and 3G services are being sunset. The Cisco Catalyst IR1101 can be expanded to host a second wireless cellular module and more Ethernet and serial ports, as well as general purpose input/output (GPIO) and data storage to handle the most advanced use cases.\nLong-range, low-power connectivity with the Cisco PIM for LoRaWAN\nCustomers have asked us to connect their battery-powered LoRaWAN sensors to their networks\xe2\x80\x94and we are delivering with the new LoRaWAN module. The module enables the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router to be a LoRaWAN gateway\xe2\x80\x94delivering LoRaWAN connectivity to industrial IoT sensors that typically require low bandwidth, operate on battery, and can be deployed in difficult-to-reach locations.\nUnlike many other LoRaWAN connectivity solutions, the new module in the Catalyst IR1101 can fit in space-constrained and distributed industrial environments, giving customers the flexibility and scale to install in the locations that are best for them.\nFurthermore, using the Catalyst IR1101 with two modules allows for an integrated LoRaWAN gateway with 4G/5G backhaul capabilities in a single router that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to deploy in tight spaces.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoRaWAN plays a key role in the wireless ecosystem. It\xe2\x80\x99s important for organizations that are considering using wireless technologies in their operations to evaluate all multi-RAN standards, whether LoRaWAN, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, etc., to address each use case with the right single- or multi-technology solution. Cisco is enabling just that by bringing LoRaWAN capabilities to its industrial router, enhancing an already flexible, scalable, and secure solution to meet a variety of wireless needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDonna Moore, CEO LoRa Alliance\n  Provide connectivity to your critical infrastructure with the PIM for 450MHz LTE\nThe 450MHz LTE module allows the Catalyst IR1101 to provide connectivity for mission-critical government use cases, including critical infrastructure and public safety. Connect devices such as industrial control systems and physical security equipment over a private LTE network using the 450MHz band. Public protection and disaster recovery (PPDR) regulations in Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Africa allow critical industries to reserve the 450MHz band in their areas to deploy private LTE networks, replacing legacy public safety voice networks with technology capable of data transmission. The 450MHz band provides high resiliency and deep indoor signal penetration to connect the Catalyst IR1101 anywhere onsite.\nEasily manage your infrastructure with IoT Operations Dashboard\nEasily connect, maintain, and manage network devices and industrial assets with Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. The cloud-based IoT services platform enables easy deployment of the Catalyst IR1101 at scale, supporting wired or wireless backhaul connectivity. IoT Operations Dashboard is designed for industrial use cases: Its Secure Equipment Access service enables operations teams to easily manage connected assets remotely to minimize site visits and maximize uptime. Its Cyber Vision service provides deep visibility into assets, so that you can better manage resources, limit exposure to cyberthreats, and drive cybersecurity best practices.\nA valuable investment for today\xe2\x80\x99s industrial applications\nCisco offers a comprehensive industrial IoT portfolio to help customers meet their unique connectivity requirements. It combines modular routers supporting a wide range of private and public cellular and other wireless technologies; a cloud platform designed to easily deploy, secure, and manage distributed industrial networks; secure remote access capabilities to remotely configure and maintain assets; and more.

4,OT/IoT Security: 3 Key Takeaways from Gartner Peer Insight’s Survey,Fabien Maisl,"b'In the event of a cyberattack, are industrial organizations prepared to defend their operational technology (OT) and industrial control system (ICS) environments? Cisco set out to answer this question in a survey conducted together with Gartner Peer Insights and Takepoint Research in Q3CY22. The audience for the survey involved IT, OT, engineering, and InfoSec professionals across the globe.\nResults showed that 77 percent of industrial organizations are still in the beginning stages of their OT security journeys. And none of the participants have fully secured their OT/ICS environments yet. This fact is worrying, considering the post-pandemic world in which we find ourselves.\nMuch has changed over the last three years. The pandemic has significantly accelerated the digital transformation of OT, which has led to most\xe2\x80\x94if not all\xe2\x80\x94of organizations\xe2\x80\x99 critical operations to be integrated with digital technologies. In turn, cyberattacks such as those suffered by Colonial Pipeline, Oldsmar Water, and JBS in 2021 have become more prevalent as bad actors focus on the vulnerabilities of OT/ICS networks.\nOur conversations with C-suite executives reveal that most organizations recognize that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for a cyberattack and that many are just starting to prioritize OT security. Our survey reveals that the main goal for 58 percent of respondents is to gain comprehensive visibility on OT devices and industrial networks.\nHowever, a stunning 74 percent say that the main obstacle to securing OT at scale is the cost and complexity of building an out-of-band Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) network or deploying the network TAPs required to gain such visibility. But there is an alternative way to collect this data and build comprehensive visibility into the industrial network.\nCisco Cyber Vision embeds visibility features into network equipment, eliminating the need for sourcing, deploying, and managing dedicated security appliances or investing in costly out-of-band collection networks. This architecture provides unmatched visibility as passive discovery is achieved at every layer of the industrial network and active discovery requests are not blocked by NAT or firewall boundaries.\nOur survey highlights other interesting facts, such as the critical need to implement secure remote access solutions into the industrial network and the need to control shadow IT practices in industrial networks now that operations teams are using more cloud and industrial IoT solutions. For more insights, see the survey results in this infographic.\nFor a deeper analysis of these survey findings, download our survey report that covers all the questions we asked our panel of professionals. The report also explains how to avoid some of the obstacles that OT security specialists face during deployment.\nTo learn more about how you can secure your IoT/OT infrastructure, visit our IoT Security page or contact us.\nTo get the latest industry news on IoT Security delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Report Manufacturing Utilities,"February 23, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
5,Cisco IoT enables the global acceleration of offshore wind energy,Marcus Smith,"b'Renewable energy is a hot topic right now. Most countries globally are investing in renewable energy generation to accelerate the move toward carbon neutrality. The following technologies are not only growing steadily, but they are also mainstream now:\nOnshore and offshore wind\nOnshore solar farms\nOnshore battery storage\nOther renewable technologies are also being researched and developed (e.g. wave, tidal, other storage technologies), and we will start to see more innovative renewable energy deployments in the foreseeable future.\nSome countries are leading the push on integrating renewable energy into the grid. China and the UK are examples of countries leading the way with large deployments of wind capacity (both onshore and offshore). Europe in general is setting big targets for offshore wind and the US is also predicted to become a major offshore wind energy producer in the coming decade. Cisco can help with all these renewable energy technologies but for the purpose of this discussion, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the complexities offshore wind farms are facing and the solutions Cisco offers.\nDeploying and operating these renewable technologies can be challenging: they need to operate in harsh and remote locations, a secure and reliable network is required, and that network needs to work flawlessly with the various OT and IT technologies that form the solution.\nThis is where Cisco IoT solutions provide the foundation for the network.\nOffshore wind farms are large infrastructure deployments with multiple locations. They require:\nOnshore substation\nOffshore substation (platform offshore)\nOffshore wind turbines (ranging from 50 to 300 turbines)\nOnshore operations and maintenance offices\nOffshore Service Operations Vessels (worker accommodation, offices, and workshops while offshore)\nCisco has developed a complete Validated Design for these offshore wind farm projects. It provides customers with a blueprint solution for all phases of a project (from specification and procurement to deployment).\nThe solution includes networking infrastructure from the offshore wind turbine itself through the offshore platforms to the onshore WAN interface point and connectivity to the wind farm operators control center.\nThe Cisco CVD is modular to allow for varying wind farm sizes (i.e. design can flex to cope with increased number of turbines), provides resilient architectures to allow for fault conditions, and includes cyber security built in from the start.\nOffshore wind farms are very challenging to deploy, and automation is a key component during the deployment phase. Cisco DNA Center provides a single platform to allow zero touch deployment of infrastructure (switch and routers) at Day 0 and the ongoing management of the network.\nAdditional use cases include Service Operations Vessel (SOV) connectivity using Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul to provide high bandwidth connectivity while the SOV is offshore in the windfarm.\nThe Cisco Offshore Wind CVD provides the following benefits:\nPre-validated design and configurations\nProduct choices and validated firmware versions\nAutomation through plug and play capabilities in Cisco products\nCentralized security policies including segregation of services\nModular designs to flex for bigger projects\nValidated resilient topologies\nPlatform architecture to support existing and future devices\nValidated QOS and security configurations\nIn summary, the offshore wind farm solution provides a proven and validated blueprint for connecting devices and production assets, improving industrial security, and improving data access and operating reliability. Following this best practice blueprint with Cisco market-leading technologies will help decrease deployment time, decrease risk, decrease complexity, and improve overall security and operating uptime. The Cisco Validated Design will be available end of March. To learn more now, check out the Solution Brief for Renewable Energy\xe2\x80\x94 Offshore Wind.\nGot question?

6,MWC Barcelona: What connections will you make in 2023?,Patrick Grossetete,"b'As Mobile World Congress Barcelona fast approaches, we anticipate a productive and energizing event. More specifically, we look forward to great discussions on monetizing 5G networks. That includes opportunities for telecommunications service providers to use Cisco solutions to better support their industrial customers.\nMany industrial operations consist of numerous systems highly distributed over a site, region, or country. Think of renewable energy production such as solar and wind farms, electric-vehicle charging stations, power substations, roadways equipment, and pipelines. In most cases, wireless cellular networks are probably the most convenient way to provide the wide coverage needed to connect these operational technology (OT) assets.\nEnhancing reliable and secure connectivity at the industrial edge is key to automating industrial processes even further, driving efficiency and improving both environmental sustainability and customer satisfaction. Yet within many industrial organizations, operations teams are stretched thin. Few have the depth and breadth of expertise needed to manage large numbers of endpoint devices across a highly distributed network.\nTelecommunications service providers can help to build and maintain secure industrial networks at scale by offering Cisco 4G/5G industrial routers, such as the Catalyst IR1101 Rugged Router with automated device provisioning and cellular broadband services. They are a winning solution for service providers in simplifying deployment and growing their footprints with industrial customers.\nAt Cisco Live Europe in Amsterdam earlier this month, we unveiled several innovations to further simplify IT for managing and securing industrial networks at scale. At Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, we\xe2\x80\x99ll build on the Cisco Live announcement and add new wireless innovations to the Cisco Industrial Networking portfolio. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a preview of what we will be showcasing:\nCatalyst IR1101 and IR1800 Rugged Series Routers: These compact and highly modular rugged industrial routers are designed for connecting fixed or mobile assets.

7,Industrial IoT takes center stage at Cisco Live EMEA,Fabien Maisl,"b'Cisco Live EMEA wrapped up last week. And while the event is over, the momentum continues to build.\nConversations in Amsterdam affirmed that industrial organizations have set their sights on increasing productivity and sustainability. They want to revolutionize how they connect, manage, and secure their operations \xe2\x80\x93 and they realize that technology is essential to that goal.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re investing in building networks in new places: roadways and bridges, wind and solar farms, utility grids and manufacturing lines. These sites are often remote with harsh environmental conditions. And industrial locations can number in the hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands \xe2\x80\x93 and be spread across regions or entire countries.\nNow consider what it takes to manage a traditional IT network: deploying and configuring hardware and software. Monitoring network infrastructure and connected devices. Keeping it all up, running, and secure. Given the realities of industrial networks, those are daunting requirements even for IT networking veterans. For most industrial operations teams, however, they represent entirely new \xe2\x80\x93 and highly complex \xe2\x80\x93 responsibilities. They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for help as they strive to realize the full potential of digitization.\nTechnologies are driving sustainability\nDuring the opening keynote, Vincenzo Ranieri, CEO of ENEL Distribution, explained how this world leading energy distribution company moved to a cloud operating model to connect and manage millions of renewable electricity production resources and reshape the power distribution value chain. Cisco has been a key partner in the past decade to help ENEL reinvent their network infrastructure, converge IT and OT to actively manage resources and enable a resilient smart grid at the scale required for such a massive transformation to a more sustainable energy production model.\nDuring the industrial IoT iTalk keynote, Chris McGookin, Lead Cyber and Telecoms Engineer at ScottishPower Renewables, explained the complexity of the industrial environment he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for. Operating windfarms in the middle of the ocean is probably one of the most challenging networking tasks. It requires a variety of fixed and wireless network technologies, connecting critical remote systems, and involving teams that need to be able to integrate these seamlessly so they can focus on the job at hand. Cisco is providing ScottishPower Renewables a comprehensive, hardened, and secure technology stack to enable simple deployment of complex industrial networks that can be remotely managed and easily duplicated to new sites.\nSimplifying IT for OT\nAt Cisco Live EMEA, our conversations focused on offering users a wide choice of networking technologies to enable their specific industrial use cases, and making deployment, management, operations, and security simple so anyone could be all in.

8,New innovations to simplify IT for industrial networks,Vikas Butaney,"b'Customers across the globe and across industries are extending their enterprise network to new places \xe2\x80\x93 whether that\xe2\x80\x99s roadways and intersections, utility grids, manufacturing lines, or even remote operations for wind farms. They are also prioritizing sustainability across their operations. But, to digitize these environments and build a greener future, they must overcome challenges, from complex connectivity needs and managing highly distributed assets through security and talent shortages.\nSolving these challenges takes a new approach. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at Cisco is that a strong partnership between all technology teams \xe2\x80\x93 whether security, networking or operations \xe2\x80\x93 is essential. Organizations need a unified, cloud-delivered approach that brings the power of the enterprise IT network to scale and secure the industrial edge. Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing new innovations leveraging the cloud to accelerate operational efficiency between these teams, reduce downtime, and enhance overall safety and security.\n  Accelerating IT and OT success through cloud-driven automation and security convergence\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard provides cloud-delivered OT services for industrial networks. Today we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing two new cloud-based innovations in this IoT Operations Dashboard to help ensure secure operations and deliver remote access to operational devices.\nDeep visibility of connected industrial assets and your security posture: Cisco Cyber Vision is now integrated as a service in IoT Operations Dashboard. Cyber Vision delivers deep visibility into connected assets on the industrial network so that IT and OT teams can implement cybersecurity best practices. Cyber Vision automatically builds a detailed asset inventory and identifies vulnerabilities. It leverages risk scores from Cisco Kenna to then prioritize vulnerabilities for the OT teams to action. It also shares your OT asset inventory with SecureX, Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s XDR platform. Security analysts now have a full inventory of both IT and OT assets to make threat investigations easier and build remediation workflows to secure the industrial environment.\nSecure equipment access to industrial assets from anywhere: Secure Equipment Access Plus is now available in IoT Operations Dashboard. Now operations teams can remotely deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot all types of assets connected to Cisco industrial routers \xe2\x80\x93 from equipment in roadside cabinets to controllers in hard-to-reach wind turbines. This not only helps customers increase their asset uptime, but it also reduces the need for time consuming and expensive truck rolls.\n  Expanding network connectivity choices for industrial use cases\nAs the network extends further into operational areas, we continue to expand our industrial networking portfolio to ensure customer success for a wide variety of deployment scenarios and locations.\nSecure and faster connectivity for space-constrained use cases. Our new Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series switches are small, DIN-rail mounted, fully managed, all gigabit ethernet switches to connect robots, controllers, and more in harsh industrial, outdoor, and tight spaces, like in a cabinet. These switches run the IOS-XE operating software with built-in trust and security, are managed by Cisco DNA Center.\nConnect to more devices wirelessly. Even on the move. Our new Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Wireless Client is purpose-built to reliably connect mobile industrial assets, such as autonomous robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). It gives users flexibility as it can operate with standard Wi-Fi deployments or in a Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (Cisco URWB) infrastructure to deliver ultra-reliable connectivity with zero packet loss and seamless handoffs.\nFiberless wireless backhaul. The new Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point provides wireless backhaul with built-in antennas that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to deploy when fiber or cellular is not an option. External antennas can be added to support fixed and mobile use cases simultaneously.\nA digitalized, resilient and reliable power system is a precondition for reaching the ambitious goals set by European Green Deal and to finally achieve a net-zero emissions society. Cisco is a key partner in our digitalization journey and its advanced industrial networking capabilities have enabled us to optimize, secure and digitalize our energy distribution networks at scale \xe2\x80\x93 all through a mutual understanding of the respective challenges and a common willingness to contribute for the successful transition of our energy system.\n\xe2\x80\x93Vincenzo Ranieri, CEO, e-distribuzione\nAs Siemens Gamesa is deploying a growing number of wind turbines across the world, we need innovative technologies to accelerate adoption of renewable and sustainable energy. We\xe2\x80\x99re partnering with Cisco to build networking solutions for our turbines so we can automate deployments, support harsh environmental conditions, handle complex power-grid specificities, and even deliver mobile wireless connectivity where cellular is not an option. Cisco solutions are helping us converge IT and OT, better handle complex operational constraints, and address ever increasing regulatory and cybersecurity requirements.\n\xe2\x80\x93Jan Holmberg Jakobsen, Team Lead for OT Network Development, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy A/S\nNetwork Rail own, repair, and develop Britain\xe2\x80\x99s railway infrastructure. It\xe2\x80\x99s our role to run a safe, reliable, and efficient railway to get people and goods where they need to be. Operational data and analytics are becoming increasingly important for us in driving efficiencies and improving our services. Platforms such as the new IE3100 will allow us to securely deploy sensor and analytics services at the trackside to help us reach key goals.\n\xe2\x80\x93Brian Hatfield, Director of Telecom Services, Network Rail\nCollectively these innovations accelerate a strong partnership between IT and OT teams \xe2\x80\x93 helping organizations simplify IT for distributed networks, securely connect their IoT operations at scale, and experience significant gains in productivity and efficiency.\n  Learn more\nRegister for our customer Webinar: New innovations to simplify IT for industrial networks\nAdditional resources\nIoT Operations Dashboard\nCyber Vision & IoT Operations Dashboard At-A-Glance\nCatalyst IE3100 Rugged Series\nCatalyst IW9165E Rugged Series\nCatalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Series\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Access Point and Wireless Client Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Network Automation Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Live EMEA Utilities Wireless Backhaul Cisco Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point,"February 7, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

10,Securing industrial networks can – and should – be simple,Andrew McPhee,"b'Implementing security inside the industrial network can be a daunting task. Security directives such as CISA\xe2\x80\x99s Shields Up have caused more industrial organizations to assess their network posture and seek guidance to improve the protections of critical resources for business continuity. Upon seeking this guidance, many are left confused with terms such as Zero Trust and Microsegmentation, resulting in more questions and no route to action.\nSecurity can, and should, be simple. Whether you follow guidance from ISA/IEC 62443\xe2\x80\x94the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\xe2\x80\x94or have implemented the Purdue model, the core security principle is to divide the network into multiple zones and create policy for the communication that crosses zone boundaries.\nDefining secured zones\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take the ISA/IEC 62443 definition of zones and conduits. A zone, according to the standard, is a collection of physically and functionally united assets that have similar security requirements. In a manufacturing facility, this could be a single production line. A conduit is described as the communication between zones. The conduit is the communication channel in which security policy should be applied.\nDefining the zones and knowing which policy to assign to the conduits is what makes security perceived as difficult. However, segmentation should not be viewed as a single standalone task. Effective segmentation is comprised of two key pillars: visibility and control.\nICS visibility informs OT segmentation\nVisibility into industrial control system (ICS) operations gives us an inventory of all assets that exist on the network, along with their communication patterns. This enables us to visualize the processes in our networks and answer the question: what are the zones on my network? Using Cisco Cyber Vision, an ICS visibility tool that is embedded into the network infrastructure, operators can identify assets that belong to a process and assign them to a group for easier visualization. Rather than focusing attention on every flow, from every asset, communication can be visualized in the conduits between the zones, providing a blueprint of the policy that must be defined.\nAs for the enforcement of these traffic patterns, that too can be embedded into the network infrastructure using a technology called TrustSec. Cisco TrustSec provides you with an easier way to manage access control policies across switches using a security group matrix.\nAs traffic enters and leaves their network segment, rather than enforcing traffic using IP information, Cisco TrustSec uses a Security Group Tag (SGT) embedded in the MAC layer of the network traffic to determine policy. Using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) SGTs can be assigned to your zones and the matrix can be used to control the communication across the conduits.\nUsing the built-in integrations, Cyber Vision shares its grouping information with Cisco ISE so operations managers can create and manage assets groups in their OT visibility tool, so IT can easily create the proper control rules between those zones in ISE.\nIn a recent webinar, I went into more details, diving into the ISA/IEC 62443 zones and conduits model and showing how to use Cisco ISE and Cyber Vision to enforce OT Microsegmentation. You can watch the replay by registering here.\nUntil then, have a look at our ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 white paper and make sure you subscribe to our Industrial Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Cisco ISE Cisco TrustSec Critical Infrastructure Featured ISA/IEC 62443 Network Segmentation,"December 13, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/IL20220725202503-anmcphee-150x150.jpeg
11,SDWAN for utility operational use? Are you sure?,Marcus Smith,"b'Enterprises have widely deployed Software Defined WAN (SDWAN) over the past 10 years. The solution delivers assurance for applications, both in the cloud and in the data center, especially for remote users. The migration of many enterprise applications to the cloud during the pandemic has further driven the use of SDWAN. But does it offer any real benefits for utilities? Can it help utilities with deploying WAN connectivity to substations and distributed renewable energy sites? The answer is definitely Yes! And SDWAN can even provide benefits to simplify and streamline the provisioning of WAN infrastructure to these remote operational sites.\nMost utilities today are used to building large networks utilizing technologies such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN) to encrypt critical Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) communications, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for the underlying transport network, and public or private cellular for remote sites with no other WAN connectivity. SDWAN brings these technologies together and enables automation to greatly simplify deployments.\nAutomation benefits\nZero Touch deployment of field gateways (i.e., no field staff required to configure a gateway)\nSimple provisioning of service VPNs to segregate traffic (SCADA, CCTV, PMU, IP Telephony etc)\nTemplated configurations making it easy to change configuration and push it to gateways.\nApplication of unified security policies across a diverse range of remote sites and equipment\nManaging multiple backhaul connectivity options at the gateway including private MPLS for critical SCADA traffic and cellular for backup and even internet-based connections for non-critical traffic, where appropriate.\nLifecycle management of gateways (e.g., firmware updates, alarm monitoring and statistics)\nDeploying an SDWAN Overlay also allows the utility to control the end-to-end IP addressing schemes and remove the need to engineer complex routing plans based on the underlying transport network, quite often provided by a 3rd party service provider. This divorces the underlying transport network from the overlay network. Hence, it simplifies operational tasks and provides less reliance on the underlying network providers to make changes, which often have a cost associated for the utility such as adding a new service VPN for a new service is as simple as adding it to your gateway templates and deploying it.\nExamples of SDWAN technologies deployed by utilities\nSubstation gateway \xe2\x80\x93 larger substation gateways providing resilient WAN connectivity and security functionality (Zone based Firewall)\nDistribution Automation \xe2\x80\x93 secondary substations, pole mounted equipment or other field assets such as reclosers or capacitor banks.\nRenewable energy sites \xe2\x80\x93 connecting onshore wind turbines, solar plants, and battery storage sites.\nDistributed renewable energy sites\nUtilities are now having to connect an array of renewable energy assets, spread across wide geographic areas. Onshore wind, solar and battery storage elements are examples of assets that need to be connected to the utility for monitoring and/or control.\nMany renewable asset operators are also using public and private cloud-based applications, including SCADA. SDWAN can add further benefits in assuring application performance and reliability to the cloud.\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be beneficial to have a single solution with a choice of industrial gateways for different site types? We think so and Cisco provides several industrial routers to suit all deployment sites and can be managed as part of the Cisco SDWAN solution.\nCisco IoT products such as the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Series Routers for larger substations, Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers for distribution sites, and Cisco Catalyst IR8140 Heavy Duty Series Routers for outdoor field sites can all operate as SDWAN edge gateways alongside with the well-known Cisco Enterprise routers (Virtual and physical), which can be used for control centres and other operational sites to provide a single overlay network connecting to any site.\nSo, in summary, the Cisco SDWAN solution coupled with Cisco IoT Catalyst Industrial Routers is very relevant to Utility operational networks and can offer many benefits. Without compromising security, the solution is easy to use and allows to automate tasks that utilities needed to handle manually before. For Utilities already using the Cisco SDWAN solution for IT related use cases, it is easy to add Industrial endpoints to extend services to the substations. For customers using Cisco Industrial Routers today, SDWAN can be a powerful addition to the provision and management of the WAN.\nLearn more\nCisco SDWAN Solution\nCisco Substation Automation Validated Designs\nCisco IoT Catalyst Industrial Routers\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco SDWAN Cisco Validated Designs Distribution Automation Substation Automation Utilities,"December 1, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/01/IL20220124192807-Marcus-Smith-150x150.jpg
12,Connected Trackside: Delivering resilience and security,Wei Zou,"b'  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  I recently shared some key trends and challenges rail operators are navigating, as well as Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s approach to strengthening and securing onboard network infrastructure in this blog series. For this post, let\xe2\x80\x99s explore the building blocks of modern trackside networks.\nAs rail operators invest in Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC), they need trackside network infrastructure that supports ultra-reliable train-to-wayside wireless connectivity, resilience and high availability, and robust cybersecurity.\nCisco has designed an architecture that supports CBTC, vital signaling, level crossing, and other safety-critical applications. And because the same trackside infrastructure supports asset monitoring, video surveillance, passenger Wi-Fi, and other non-vital systems, the Cisco solution curbs the time and costs associated with implementation, operations, and maintenance. This unified infrastructure offers advantages that rail operators\xe2\x80\x99 aging \xe2\x80\x93 and often siloed \xe2\x80\x93 networks simply can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver.\nSignaling resilience\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s solution uses a tiered architecture composed of an access layer with ruggedized IP switching infrastructure, a highly redundant and reliable service provider or large enterprise\xe2\x80\x93grade backbone networks, and a data center connectivity layer. Together, these elements offer resilient communications paths \xe2\x80\x93 at scale \xe2\x80\x93 between trains, tracksides, stations, and operations control centers.\nSolution highlights include Cisco ruggedized Catalyst Industrial Ethernet switches at the access and distribution layer. The resilient ring topology connects trackside and station equipment, such as wayside radio, axle counter, interlocking, and other CBTC equipment. At the aggregation and backbone layer, the Cisco solution helps achieve sub-50-millisecond fast reconvergence. It achieves that by migrating from legacy circuit-based transport infrastructure to Unified Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) backhaul with fast reroute protection, by simplifying existing MPLS infrastructure with Segment Routing (SR), or by deploying a Cisco Connected Communities Infrastructure (CCI) multiservice architecture.\nSecuring trackside\nAs with all industrial organizations, rail operators are concerned about cyber security. Many have experienced a security incident; most have expressed concern about the adequacy of their current security practices.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s industrial security journey provides a step-by-step path toward information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) convergence. It starts with building a security foundation by defining the IT/OT security boundary with Cisco secure firewall. From there, apply Cisco Cyber Vision to gain asset visibility, communication patterns, device security posture, and operational insight. Then use visibility to drive industrial network segmentation and integrate with Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) for security policy automation. Lastly, investigate threats and orchestrate response with SecureX.\nAutonomous operating systems could reduce rail traffic fatalities by up to 90%. In addition to saving lives, such a reduction would avoid US$900 billion annually in associated public health costs.[1] Resilient, secure trackside network infrastructure is a key to realizing those compelling outcomes \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s exciting to be part of that solution.\nTo learn more about the solution, please check out Cisco Connected Rail Solution Brief.\n  [1] McKinsey, \xe2\x80\x9cSignals for Growth\xe2\x80\x94how OEMs can be successful in a digitalized infrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Rail: Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Transportation Wireless Backhaul,"November 17, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607133038-Wei-Zou-150x150.jpeg
13,Three ways to extend your existing IT practice into new buying centers,Vikas Butaney,"b'This morning I sat down with my coffee to read the headlines on my iPhone. And it really struck me how aligned our IoT business is to what I was reading. Energy changes around the world are impacting the macro-level global economy. Legislation and initiatives towards sustainability are reducing our carbon footprint. Cybersecurity is protecting our businesses and institutions. Technology is the common thread through all these initiatives and IoT delivers the common foundation of robust and secure connectivity.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why Cisco and our trusted network of partners are in a unique position to shine. As partners look to increase their relevance to their customer\xe2\x80\x99s business, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look far. Partners can quickly and easily leverage existing Networking and Security practices and investments in training and certifications to get to new buyers in new places with untapped budgets like:\nBusinesses connecting their operations to lower energy usage and increase physical security with cameras and environmental sensors\nManufacturers using industrial IoT to improve plant floor efficiency and uptime\nUtilities securely weaving renewables into the grid\nCities and roadways becoming safer with smart highways and transportation\nAcross the globe, countries investing billions in critical infrastructure projects\nAs IT customers extend their network into their operational areas like these, there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge opportunity to take Cisco IoT with them. How can partners get started? Let me take you on a short journey through three IT partner stories where you see how they took their IT practice to new areas.\nTake Cisco DNA Center to new places with the existing teams\nMany of our IT partners have built practices around Cisco DNA Center and the robust automation capabilities to deploy campus networks and our Catalyst product family. That same Cisco DNA Center being used to manage the Catalyst products can also manage the Catalyst Industrial Ethernet product lines. The same software, same trainings, same licensing model, and same software sales model motion can now also serve outdoor parking lots, distribution centers, and more. That means our partners don\xe2\x80\x99t need to retrain and reorganize to get to these new budgets.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with a partner that\xe2\x80\x99s extending their enterprise practice into non-carpeted spaces \xe2\x80\x93 like manufacturing floors. Atea is a leading technology service provider focused on Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Nordic and Baltic regions with over 40 years\xe2\x80\x99 experience in the IT space. As more manufacturers look to modernize their operations, Atea is seeing firsthand the value of extending their existing IT practice into these new places.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to take what was traditional enterprise solutions like Cisco DNA Center into operational areas like manufacturing for net new bookings in completely new buying centers. All without having to retrain our teams or hire new talent,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Casper Ginderskov, Business Development Manager, Atea. \xe2\x80\x9cOur practice with Cisco IoT has been part of the double-digit growth that we have had over the last 2 years. Best of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been helping our customers across manufacturing \xe2\x80\x93 pharma, automotive, consumer product goods \xe2\x80\x93 transform their own businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Grow business and profits with software and cloud management\nMany of our IT partners are looking to deliver more software solutions, as well as manage and deploy via the cloud. Recurring services are a great way to build a stickier practice with customers and widen their range of services. Leveraging Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, our partners can deploy and manage a distributed set of assets that can be located anywhere for retail stores, roadways and intersections, and more. They can then add value-added services like Secure Equipment Access and IOx edge application management.\nAnother great story is New Frontier Technologies and their work with Energybox. New Frontier Technologies, a Cisco IT partner, has decades of experience merging field level automation with corporate level networking \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cwhere operations meets IT.\xe2\x80\x9d Given the increased corporate focus on sustainability and energy usage, they saw the opportunity to extend their networking products and experience into new areas. Using the capabilities of IoT Operations Dashboard to manage a set of industrial routers, they are now able to deploy in convenience stores, fast food restaurants, and gas stations and manage remotely. Plus, they are using Secure Equipment Access to remotely maintain their connected equipment and are building new software capabilities using IOx \xe2\x80\x93 our virtualization layer to deliver innovative services.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of our IT customers has an initiative underway to better manage their energy consumption. And that means they need to be able to monitor systems like refrigeration and HVAC,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Walden, Director \xe2\x80\x93 SCADA & IT, New Frontier Technologies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to take our IT networking expertise into these operational areas for new sales in quick service restaurants (QSR) and gas stations, as well as new recurring revenue streams with value-added monitoring services.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Extend expertise into roadways and intersections\nI\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that we all will drive somewhere today or take some form of transportation. As we pass intersections with traffic cabinets and signals, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think about the industrial switch and industrial router that connects to the traffic controller to manage those traffic lights. But this use case is an amazing opportunity for Cisco partners to build capabilities around roadways and traffic intersections for managing congestion, pedestrian safety, traffic control, and roadway safety. This is an excellent way to extend IT practices and services to the public sector customers across state and local governments, and Department of Transportations \xe2\x80\x93 and tap into government infrastructure funds. All these services are built on a foundation of secure reliable networking.\nCDW is a leading provider of IT solutions to business, government, education and healthcare customers in the US, the UK, and Canada.

14,Connected Train: Simplifying the onboard network,Wei Zou,"b'  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\nIn the first blog in this blog series I shared that passenger volumes for urban railways, automated people movers (APMs), and other forms of mass transit continue to grow. To satisfy increasing demand while meeting safety, passenger experience, and operational efficiency goals, rail operators are ramping up investments in innovative technology solutions.\nOne of the most important is Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC). In the simplest of terms, CBTC puts passenger rail on \xe2\x80\x9cauto-pilot.\xe2\x80\x9d This high level of automation offers significant benefits for rail operators and their passengers. But CBTC also introduces new networking challenges, including the need for a simpler yet more powerful network on board each train car.\nWith the move to CBTC, rail operators are taking a fresh look at their onboard train network, implementing a multiservice foundation that shifts from disjointed proprietary networks to a common IP network.\nAt Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a network architecture that both strengthens and simplifies the onboard train network. As part of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Train solution, we provide a resilient infrastructure capable of supporting numerous services and use cases. Whether supporting vital applications such as CBTC, or non-vital applications such as passenger WiFi, CCTV, infotainment, digital signage and point-of-sale systems, the Cisco Connected Train onboard network provides the needed bandwidth, reliability, and security.\nA linchpin of our architecture is the Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series. This next-generation, IP67-rated switching platform is designed to provide enhanced network-based security, segmentation, and visibility in the most demanding environments. It can stand up to the harsh conditions rail operators often face such as heavy vibration, extreme weather, exposure to water and dust. Additionally, it is compliant with the stringent onboard rail industry standards.\nIn addition to physical durability, cyber security is another area of strength for the IE3400 Heavy Duty Series switches. Because they are powered by Cisco IOS XE, a next-generation operating system, security, and trust are built in via Secure Boot, image signing, and the Cisco Trust Anchor module.\nThe Cisco Catalyst IW9167 Series access point is another key player in our onboard network architecture. This access point provides reliable wireless connectivity for mission-critical applications on board rail cars. It can operate as Wi-Fi 6 or Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul \xe2\x80\x93 offering flexibility and mobility to accommodate evolving needs.\nWhen running in Wi-Fi mode, it provides Wi-Fi connectivity to rail personnel and passengers within the train. When connectivity provided from Cisco IW9167E (CURWB) or Cisco FM4500 wireless radio, it delivers fiber-like train-to-ground communication for both vital and nonvital applications. In either mode, it delivers the high level of bandwidth that modern rail systems \xe2\x80\x93 and their Wi-Fi-dependent passengers \xe2\x80\x93 require.\nA simple and reliable onboard network is critical to the success of CBTC systems. Another important component is resilient and secured trackside infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 a topic I\xe2\x80\x99ll dive into in my next post.\nIn the meantime, learn more about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities for railways, check out Cisco Connected Rail solution design zone.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series Cisco Catalyst IW9167E Heavy Duty Access Points Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Rail: Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Wireless Backhaul,"October 27, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607133038-Wei-Zou-150x150.jpeg
15,Leveraging ISA/IEC 62443 to secure industrial operations is easier than you think,Fabien Maisl,"b'To many people, the ISA99/IEC 62443 industrial security standard is like a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution: You know it will bring you great benefits, so you start working on it, but you eventually give up because it looks complex or other priorities arise. But it really should not be like that. Let me explain why.\nIndustrial networks and critical infrastructures have become the new playground for cyber criminals. Whether you run global manufacturing operations, a local water utility, a power grid network or just a small industrial plant in the middle of nowhere, you are eligible for a cyber attack. What would be the result? Production halts, loss of revenue, broken industrial equipment, damage to the environment, or even injured employees. Nothing else should be higher on your priority list than securing your industrial operations.\nThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have developed the ISA99/IEC 62443 series of standards. It is a framework to implement industrial cybersecurity best practices step by step and drive continuous improvement. The series covers many aspects, but the key part is ISA/IEC 62443-3-3, which describes the security capabilities you should implement.\nSecurity requirements for all industry verticals\nSome might think that ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 is only suited for manufacturing operations, but most of its security requirements apply to all industry verticals. Furthermore, the ISA and IEC are now working on developing profiles for specific industries, so whatever you implement today will be leveraged tomorrow to comply with a more thorough list of requirements.\nTo drive you through the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3, my colleagues Andrew McPhee and Maik Seewald have written a short and detailed white paper listing all security requirements and how to comply. The main key takeaway is that by leveraging Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive industrial networking and cybersecurity portfolio, implementing the standard couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be easier.\nAs an example, the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 highlights the imperative of controlling access to resources and restricting communications by enforcing the least privilege principle that grants users and devices only the rights they need to perform their tasks. In a nutshell, asset identification, user authentication, and micro-segmentation are a must to reduce the exposure of the industrial control system (ICS) to cyberthreats and limit the spread of attacks.\nUsing Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) together with Cisco Cyber Vision, Secure Firewall, and Duo, industrial organizations can easily implement this zero-trust approach to their OT networks. These products have been designed and tested together to enable seamless workflows and out-of-the-box integration. I told you it did not have to be complex!\nThree webinars to deep dive into ISA/IEC 62443\nAndrew and Maik presented a webinar explaining the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 and its security requirements. Learn about capabilities you might be missing today and how you can easily implement them.\nSee how to implement micro-segmentation in industrial networks. Dive into the ISA/IEC 62443 zones and conduits model and how Cisco ISE and Cyber Vision can enforce OT micro-segmentation.\nSecuring industrial operations also means leveraging IT security tools and processes. Learn how to extend IT security to industrial operations so security analysts can investigate and remediate threats across both IT and OT domains.\nWatch the webinars on demand here.\nUntil then, have a look at our ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 white paper and make sure you subscribe to our Industrial Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Duo Security Cisco Industrial Security Cisco ISE Cisco Secure Firewall Cisco Zero Trust Critical Infrastructure ISA/IEC 62443 Manufacturing Utilities,"October 26, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
16,Secure the ‘last foot’ in distribution automation,Pete Kavanagh,"b'Have you ever noticed the small metal boxes attached to utility poles? If you\xe2\x80\x99re like most people, you probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid much attention to these cabinets. For Cisco and our partner, SEL, those utility cabinets presented an opportunity for innovation.\nInside each metal box are two devices: a recloser control, which mitigates the dangers of unusually high electric currents, and a router, which uses cellular service and a virtual private network (VPN) to link the recloser control to the utilities\xe2\x80\x99 wide-area network (WAN). The VPN protects grid communications between the boxes and the control center.\nBut there is still a vulnerability within each box. Cisco and SEL have joined forces to secure what is quite literally the \xe2\x80\x9clast foot\xe2\x80\x9d in distribution automation.\nCisco and SEL\xe2\x80\x99s solution for the \xe2\x80\x98last foot\xe2\x80\x99 problem\nThough hardened for physical security, utility boxes are not impossible to breach. Breaking into one yields access to the recloser control, the router, and the network cable \xe2\x80\x93 usually about one foot \xe2\x80\x93 that connects the two pieces of hardware.\nCurrently, these devices communicate with clear text, so important communications can be read by anyone with the technical know-how to intercept them. In other words, this \xe2\x80\x9clast foot\xe2\x80\x9d represents a potential vulnerability as an entry point to damage or assume control of the recloser. That could lead to undesirable consequences \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from nuisance maintenance tasks to power grid disruption.\nTogether, Cisco and SEL have created the first solution for encrypting the network traffic that travels the short but critical distance between an SEL-651R/RA recloser controls and a Cisco Catalyst IR1101 Rugged Router.\nWe built this solution using IEEE 802.1AE Media Access Control Security (MACsec) and the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) portion of 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control. We chose MACsec because it is a mature, proven, and open standard. It\xe2\x80\x99s also stable, having undergone few updates since its publication in 2006 yet it still delivers strong encryption today.\nApplying this standard on Cisco and SEL hardware, it becomes possible to secure recloser communications without investing in external devices. The solution will be available at the end of 2022, enabling utilities to begin upgrading their distribution automation environment.\nCoordinating activities across functional groups within the utility can be extremely difficult. With that in mind, we designed the solution to be implemented in two phases. The first phase involves a truck roll to physically update each location as required. The second phase involves updating the configuration and can be handled remotely and without any disruption of service to the grid.\nGoing the extra mile for the \xe2\x80\x98last foot\xe2\x80\x99\nAs security threats and risks to utilities continue to increase, this standards-based solution from Cisco and SEL represents a vitally important tool for hardening critical infrastructure. We invite you to dive deeper into the solution by reading Securing the \xe2\x80\x98Last Foot\xe2\x80\x99 in Distribution Automation, a white paper Cisco and SEL published during DistribuTECH.\nTo explore how this solution can help you, contact us.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Routers Critical Infrastructure Distribution Automation Utilities,"October 25, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/IL20220711165719-pkavanag-150x150.jpeg
17,Four must-haves in the New Digital Substation,Paul Didier,"b'Throughout electrical substations change continues to surge.\nFor decades, utilities routed power from centralized sources. Now they are orchestrating power generation across diverse and distributed sources, including renewables like wind and solar. Substations also are navigating more complex demands as we electrify transportation such as EV\xe2\x80\x93with a growing segment of customers consuming and producing electricity.\nWhat will it take to evolve substations to address operational, customer service, cost efficiency, and environmental goals?\nThe answer is continued investment in substation automation and digitization to create an intelligent and secure electrical delivery system that relies on communications and information technology. Cisco calls this the New Digital Substation. Unlike traditional operations, the New Digital Substation handles more sustainable, distributed, and variable energy supplies as well as fluctuating demand all in real time.\nBuilding on more than a decade of experience supporting substation automation, Cisco recently published the Substation Automation 3.0 Design Guide. This Cisco Validated Design (CVD) builds on previous solutions supporting SCADA operational systems \xe2\x80\x93 and it stands out for four new and differentiated capabilities. In the quest for greater flexibility, efficiency, and security, these have become must-haves in the New Digital Substation.\nMust-have #1: Resilient, Digital Operations\nThe industry is moving to connect more equipment using standard, open communications that are designed to digitally operate substation equipment. These applications require much more from the network than the typical SCADA based applications: low-latency, highly resilient and synchronization services.\nWe designed the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 and IE9300 Rugged Series Switches and the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 and IR8340 Rugged Series Routers to support substation automation applications based on IEC 61850 \xe2\x80\x93 the international standard that defines communication protocols for intelligent electronic devices within substations. These devices also support other substation communication protocols and can integrate with a host of legacy hardware.\nMust-have #2: Big bandwidth, small footprint\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s latest substation architecture features upgraded routing and switching solutions. The IR8340 hardware and IE9300 switches provide greater bandwidth along with more features in smaller physical footprints. As such, they can support a higher quantity of connected devices and applications while addressing goals for operational efficiency and operational cost containment.\nThe IR8340 is a router, switch, firewall, and precise timing module. The stackable IE9300 supports high-density fiber ports to resiliently connect lots of substation equipment while providing visibility of the substation devices and communication. Both also act as cyber security agents for the substation and have edge compute capability.\nMust-have #3: Simplified network management\nHistorically, grid operations teams have not needed IT or network management skills as they rely on \xe2\x80\x9cone and done\xe2\x80\x9d deployments. As operations become increasingly digital, utilities need to manage and monitor the networks to maintain uptime.\nThe Substation Automation 3.0 architecture reduces the need for network expertise. It incorporates Cisco DNA Center and Cisco Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies \xe2\x80\x93 which centralizes, simplifies, and automates network deployment and management. Using these tools, a smaller team can manage devices with zero-touch configuration and maintenance.\nMust-have #4: Cyber security; visibility, protection and compliance\nAs part of any community\xe2\x80\x99s critical infrastructure, substations must be hardened against cyber-security threats. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Substation Automation 3.0 architecture upgrades cyber security capabilities including Cisco Cyber Vision to provide greater visibility and protection across the full ecosystem of connected devices.\nThis visibility and protection make it possible to flag suspicious communications and protect the equipment before they compromise grid security. Enhanced security and management also help address growing requirements for cyber certification (e.g. NERC/CIP), including the need to prove that essential operational processes and procedures are in place.\nThe new energy ecosystem is rapidly taking shape and electrical substations must keep pace. Consider how the Substation Automation 3.0 Design can help.\nAs with every Cisco Validated Design, we have assembled and tested all the components of the architecture. We have validated that they address resilience and interoperability goals and we have tested their ability to support core use cases, including integrating with key vendor devices and applications.\nLearn more\nGet an introduction to the new Digital Substation in our Substation Automation Solution Brief.

18,Vision Zero guaranteed?,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\n  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  In this third blog of the series, I will explore Vision Zero, aspects of safety, the need for situational awareness, and technology applications that can improve safety.\nSafety is always a top priority in roadway operations. Both the intersections, the places where roads meet, and the stretches of road between intersections must be safe and also perceived to be safe. There is an emerging focus in Europe and the USA on what could be referred to as \xe2\x80\x98Vision Zero\xe2\x80\x99. This describes a future scenario where road infrastructure is combined with advanced information technologies to deliver the value and benefits of roads with zero fatalities or crashes.\nWhat if I told you that I have found a way to achieve Vision Zero, guaranteed, overnight? I would be able to reduce the crashes on any road to zero. How would I do this? Quite simple, close the road. Radical and impractical as we can\xe2\x80\x99t close the road, so let\xe2\x80\x99s look at why we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. While safety is always paramount, the objective is not achieved in isolation but within a balanced framework of other objectives that must also be considered. We cannot place an extreme focus on one objective to the exclusion of others. There are many other objectives that smart mobility must address, at a high-level these include efficiency, enhanced user experience, and climate change management. These are the reasons why you just can\xe2\x80\x99t close a road.\nFortunately, we are starting to understand that defining safety as a primary objective not only enables us to improve the safety situation, but also helps us to address the other objectives simultaneously, as illustrated in the figure below.\n  For example, the application of advanced technology to increase trip time reliability, smooth traffic by avoiding harsh acceleration and deceleration and form vehicles into orderly platoons, can improve safety and reduce congestion. This also addresses enhancing user experience as the driver benefits from a better experience with less stops and delays.\nSo, let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss further how Vision Zero can be achieved through the application of advanced technologies and how to move towards the goal of Vision Zero in a practical and effective way.\nThe main ingredients\nSo, what are the main ingredients of a successful approach to safety? In my opinion, they are, as shown in the figure, starting at the top of the pyramid:\nThe ability to act appropriately\nBased on a high level of situational awareness, the best responses and action plans can be developed and applied. Of course, services and applications come into play again as significant implementation tools.\nAn appropriate level of situational awareness\nFrom a safety perspective it is important to know what is happening, what will happen in the future, and what to do about it. This should encompass all aspects of safety as described above.\nServices and applications that enable you to know and act\nServices and applications deliver value to the end user including travelers and fleet operators by providing information on the best choices.\nAn efficient and effective telecommunications foundation\nSituational awareness, services, and applications can only work efficiently if they are underpinned by a firm foundation in telecommunications network infrastructure, as illustrated in the figure. Another important dimension of effective telecommunications approaches lies in system and application security. For the system or solution to do its job over an extended period, it must include cyber and physical security arrangements to protect it from those that pose a threat. It is important that these security arrangements are \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial grade\xe2\x80\x9d using the best available technology from the wider world of Internet and commercial systems. Let us also not forget physical security as there is no point in having world class cyber security if the physical security is not up to par. Easy access to cabinets and equipment would enable bad actors to undermine cyber security arrangements.\n  It is an exciting time to be involved in the mobility industry. More data is available now than ever before, and new technologies have emerged that allow us to improve safety, while also achieving our other objectives. A well-structured, robust approach should be taken that considers all aspects of safety in an integrated approach making the best use of available technology. Initiatives should be results focused, never losing sight of the intended outcomes. While careful stewardship should be applied to expenditure, the human cost of poor safety along with the cost of property damage, should justify good levels of investment, to enable objectives to be achieved.\nNow that you know what can be done if you would like to know more about smarter, greener, and safer roadways?

The program helps machine builders and niche solution integrators to create repeatable, scalable, and reliable solutions with Cisco IoT technology embedded within.\nThe benefits of the Design-In Program include direct access to a range of IoT experts, inclusion in a joint marketing program, access to a unique support model, as well as participation in a commercial partnership framework. All these benefits are available throughout the solution lifecycle.\nLeading machine tool builder Yamazaki Mazak leveraged the Design-In program to accelerate and optimize the digital solutions offered to customers as part of the Mazak iConnect solution.\nMazak iConnect is a comprehensive service that connects customers, machine tools, and Mazak\xe2\x80\x99s support center with cloud network technology. It provides various support services such as remote diagnosis of equipment.\nHistorically, deploying machines to new customers was time consuming as the process required site visits to implement the customer specific configuration. The Cisco IoT solution enables remote, secure access to the onsite machines and customer specific configuration can be implemented remotely. Meaning Mazak can deploy this service at a large scale, quickly.\nThe chosen technical solution consists of a Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers with 4G connectivity, combined with Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, a cloud-based management platform that enables Zero Touch onboarding of the remote IR1101 and subsequent provisioning of the required configuration template.

20,"Mining innovation: One access point, many solutions",Bruce Frederick,"b'Mining companies around the world have made great strides in digitalization. One of the most significant to date is the adoption of digital dispatch or Fleet Management Systems (FMS). This solution, which helps optimize truck routes, typically pays for itself in as little as four to six months on missed routes alone. Trucks burn through thousands of gallons of fuel daily. When haul trucks don\xe2\x80\x99t take the best route or go to the wrong location, the cost adds up quickly. Now, as mining enterprises pursue the next phase of digitalization, many are actively exploring two game-changing capabilities: tele-remote operations and autonomous vehicles, including autonomous haulage systems (AHS).\nWith tele-remote operations, mining companies can deploy one operator to oversee drilling and dozers across multiple sites or multiple drills and dozers at a single site. An operator works from the safety and comfort of an office \xe2\x80\x93 a significant advantage for finding and keeping talent. Meanwhile, the mining company avoids the risk and expense of sending human resources to what are often extremely remote and dangerous locations. These locations require major investments to provide even the most basic room and board for mining workers.\nAutonomous vehicles take humans out of the work altogether. These trucks run fully independently, \xe2\x80\x9cinteracting\xe2\x80\x9d with shovels and dozers to move materials safely and efficiently. In some cases, autonomous dozers can sense trucks and fill them; the trucks then transport the materials to the crusher, dump, or other location as required. Companies can trim the number of humans working in highly dangerous environments.\nBoth of these digital capabilities yield significant improvements in worker safety, operational efficiency, and long-term cost reductions. In addition, both require highly reliable and ruggedized wireless network connectivity.\nCatalyst IW9167 Heavy Duty Access Points will become available in 2023, enabling mining companies to begin implementing the infrastructure they need to reach new heights of digitalization and automation. Even better, they can implement new network infrastructure without a full shutdown to \xe2\x80\x9crip and replace\xe2\x80\x9d legacy gear.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because the IW9167 is a single access point that supports two types of connectivity: WiFi 6E using 802.11ax standards or Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul mode. With this access point, mining companies can toggle between the two modes. They can support mobile users, connect IoT sensors, and handle other traffic via WiFi \xe2\x80\x93 while carving out highly secure, ultra-low-latency connectivity to support tele-remote and autonomous systems.\nIn addition to being certified by Caterpillar, the IW9167 makes it possible to incrementally build a more robust and reliable network in mining environments. This one device replaces multiple legacy products \xe2\x80\x93 including the IW3702 Workgroup Bridge, the Cisco FM 4500, the Cisco Aironet 1572, and any other 802.11 access points that may be in use.\nYou can migrate in phases \xe2\x80\x93 for example, install several IW9167 access points each month or quarter. In time, the network will be in place to support tele-remote operations and/or autonomous vehicles, with a single type of spare simplifying ongoing maintenance and support.\nAs your mining enterprise explores the next phase of digitalization, consider the elegance and versatility of the IW9167. Review more of the details in the following materials, and let\xe2\x80\x99s stay in touch as 2023 fast approaches.\n  Learn more\nCisco Catalyst IW9167 Series Product Overview\nCisco Catalyst IW9167E Heavy Duty Access Points At-a-Glance\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IW9167 Series Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Featured Mining Open Pit & Underground Mining,"September 29, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/brfreder2.jpg-150x150.png

22,Managing the environmental impacts of European roadways and intersections,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\nThis is the second in a short series of blogs addressing the subjects: safer, smarter, and greener roadways.\nWhen I was growing up in Scotland, my grandmother would pass knowledge on to me in the form of proverbs. When I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting at a red traffic signal I remember one of her many sayings \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s fur ye, it\xe2\x80\x99ll nae gae past ye\xe2\x80\x9d, roughly translated as \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s for you, it won\xe2\x80\x99t go past you.\xe2\x80\x9d No need to worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re green time will come. At traffic signals everybody loves a green light because it means \xe2\x80\x9cgo\xe2\x80\x9d. I believe that for the entire smart roadways movement, green should mean go, too. There is an important focus on being green. From a transport point of view, this means careful management of the unwanted side effects of the transport process, while maximizing the good things that we desire \xe2\x80\x93 safety, efficiency, and great customer experience. It is a challenge to go for green while also attaining the other goals. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, but it is absolutely possible with the right approach.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoad transport constitutes the highest proportion of overall transport emissions (in 2019 it emitted 72% of all domestic and international transport GhG).\xe2\x80\x9d [1]\nWhat it means to be green\nFirst, let\xe2\x80\x99s define what it means to be green from a roadway point of view. The figure below captures the process that we need to follow. We can be greener by understanding challenges, developing appropriate responses, and implementing solutions that support responses.\nGreen has particular relevance for urban traffic signal control as every driver likes green traffic lights to keep going. More important is the ability to manage journeys through the road network in a way that optimizes traffic flow as it varies over the course of the day. Ideally, advanced traffic management will exactly align the green signal time with the traffic flow on each approach.\nGreenness for roadways\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s discuss an ideal, one-way journey as depicted in the figure below.\nThe pink line represents the planned or ideal journey, the red represents the actual journey. The nodes represent stage points in the journey. They could be timing points for a transit service, or modal interchanges for a traveler. They might also be major intersections along a limited access highway. For example, at point 2, the traveler might switch from local bus to commuter rail. You can see that at point 1, the journey is taking longer than planned. Time is made up between points 1 and 2, but lost again between points 3, 4 and 5.\nThere are two points that I would like to make here:\nFirst, the planned or ideal journey must be optimized for greenness: minimum carbon footprint, fuel consumption, and other factors that affect greenness. These include choosing the best mode of transport for the prevailing condition, matching the journey\xe2\x80\x99s purpose. It also includes managing those modes as effectively as possible, adapting to changes in the demand for transport and prevailing operating conditions. It is also essential to inform travelers about the choices they have for any journey, for any purpose, and at any time. These might be pre-planned, scheduled journeys, or spontaneous travel decisions. Mobility as a Service techniques can be used to inform the traveler, help them make a single reservation across the entire journey from origin to destination and support a single, convenient electronic payment for the travel services to be used.\nThe second point is that any deviation from the ideal or planned journey can be viewed as a \xe2\x80\x9closs of greenness.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case, the cumulative journey time increase (the red areas) could be caused by congestion or delay, reducing the journey greenness. This comparison of an ideal to actual journey is a technique used in aviation but typically not in surface transportation. In order to attain green, it will be necessary to have sufficient data collection and analytics capability to plan the optimum journey and monitor deviation from ideal during the actual journey. It will also be necessary to have the degree of situational awareness and management capability to improve the actual journey in formative, near real time ways. It is interesting to note that taking this approach to defining and measuring greenness also enables other factors to be optimized including safety, efficiency, user experience, and equity. Equity is improved by operating cost reductions making transport more accessible to all by reducing travel costs. We must go green and use management tools to stay green, for every stage of every journey.\nAchieving greenness\nThis is complicated and yes, as I said at the start, it is not easy, but it is entirely doable. It can be done by applying information and operational technologies such as those depicted in the figure below.\nThe operational technology is the part of the iceberg under water, unseen but irreplaceable. Information technology consists of various elements above the water, which deliver visible impacts but rely on the unseen operational technology. Together they support the range of customer facing applications that deliver greenness. Like the iceberg, I am focusing on just the tip of the greenness issue.\nTechnology can enable us to determine carbon impacts for different stages in the journey and all modes of transport. We can even look at the supply chains that deliver transport infrastructure and vehicles, ensuring that we optimize the bigger picture supporting circular economic approaches. Smart roadways and intersections are crucial elements in this due to the proportional impact that effective operations have on greenness. We can not only make our roadways greener, but also the entire transport system. From better intersection management to world-class high-speed highway operations, we have the tools available now to go green.\nGreen is for now\nSo why is it important for roadways to be greener now? We want to save the planet and reduce greenhouse gases (GhG)\xe2\x80\x94bold political goals have been set. Transport contributes a significant amount of GhG, especially road transport, so even a relatively small improvement would be significant. If we are to achieve these bold goals within the required time, then it\xe2\x80\x99s time to start planning and implementing. There are proven technology solutions that can be implemented off the shelf including advanced traffic management, electric cars and trucks, AI based decision support and advanced sensors. Robust, trusted OT networks can underpin the attainment of bold goals.\nGrandma\xe2\x80\x99s guide to greenness\nIn addition to her many sayings, my Grandmother would also give me sage advice. One piece of her advice was that to get what you want, there are two fundamental steps required. Step one is to decide what it is you want. Step two is to ask for it. We have obviously decided that we want greener roadways and transport. So now we have to ask for it by designing, specifying, and procuring it. It\xe2\x80\x99s still not easy being green, but it is now easier than ever due to bold political action and capable technologies. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go for green.\nLearn more\nWant to know more about smarter, greener, and safer roadways? Click here!\nVisit our booth #1246 at ITS World Congress on September 18-22, 2022.

23,Deliver next generation substation automation with the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router,Marcus Smith,"b'Substations are becoming more complex with greater demands placed on the network and connectivity. To address these challenges, our customers asked us to deliver a next-generation routing solution that builds upon our 10+ years of utility routing expertise \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve fulfilled that request with the new Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is much more than a new version of its predecessor, the Cisco 2010 Connected Grid Router. The Catalyst IR8340 is an all-new industrial routing platform that delivers powerful and versatile capabilities. It meets the substation needs of today and its modular upgradability will meet future needs with ease.\nBefore we dive deeper into how it can help you meet the increasing demands on your substation, let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss the background that led to this highly capable and unique platform.\nSubstation network operators are facing many challenges in the operational landscape. One of these is the increasing complexity of balancing the wide array of new power generation assets (such as solar and wind) with an equally complex consumption model (such as increase in electric vehicle charging). This real-time balancing act requires operators to connect more assets for increased visibility and control. Quite often it demands higher bandwidth with lower latency in a confined operational footprint.\nIn fact, many utilities require more capabilities in the same footprint of their networking infrastructure so they can reduce costs (rack space, power, cooling) and simplify the substation network complexity to aid troubleshooting.\nAs the utility grid becomes more automated, the reliance on the supporting communications network infrastructure becomes even more critical to the reliability and efficiency of the grid itself. This increase in grid digitization also enlarges the cyber security threat surface. Regulators and utilities strive for an ever-increasing security posture as many traditional substation security approaches come up short due to lack of asset visibility and centralized security policy enforcement.\nFinally, with this expansion of connected assets in the substation and the constant drive for operational efficiency, utilities are challenged on how to:\nDeploy networking equipment easily at scale and with centralized configuration control to reduce field visits.\nManage and operate these new networks through their lifecycle and ensure highest reliability.\nSecure the substation and provide asset reporting where required.\nTo solve these challenges, utilities are working toward full-scale grid modernization \xe2\x80\x94 including substation automation. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a matter of if but when and how they will upgrade.\nBased on more than a decade of global collaboration with the utility industry, we have developed solutions to digitize and automate substations including the new Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router.\nIt provides high performance routing (WAN, SDWAN), switching (substation LAN), security, timing, and edge compute, all from a single platform. It is specifically designed for the performance challenges of any substation automation architecture with a small footprint and ruggedized form factor (certified to IEC61850-3 and IEEE1613).\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is part of a new Cisco validated approach to substation automation and management. Together with the recently released Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches, the routers provide a validated architecture that unifies the substation LAN and WAN \xe2\x80\x93 adding the performance, security, scale, and management required for the modernization of the substation.\n5 essentials for the next-generation substation\nContinuing on from our previous blog, let\xe2\x80\x99s review the key points that address five critical capabilities for a modern substation with regards to the Catalyst IR8340:\nPerformance at scale. Utilities are asked to connect more assets at higher speed with more assets streaming more data (e.g., synchro phasors). The Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router provides 2 WAN ports and 12 LAN ports all within the same chassis with further modules supported to expand the WAN options. The Catalyst IR8340 has dramatically greater throughput at the WAN and LAN ports (tests have shown approx. 950Mbps for both LAN and WAN ports carrying mixed traffic) than its predecessor, the CGR2010. The router also provides routing and switching capabilities since it\xe2\x80\x99s a single integrated platform. In addition, the Catalyst IR8340 also delivers IP/MPLS support to the substation edge and supports Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s SDWAN solution as a ruggedized router.\nAsset visibility and cyber threat detection. Using the integrated edge compute capabilities of the Catalyst IR8340 as a security sensor, Cisco Cyber Vision enables utilities to gain an accurate, real-time view of their substation assets (visibility and vulnerabilities applicable) directly within the substation networks, especially when paired with Cisco Catalyst IE switches. This provides operations staff with East-West traffic visibility across the substation LAN, as well as North-South traffic visibility via the WAN to the control center. It also monitors network activity and flags anomalous behaviors that could indicate malicious activity\xe2\x80\x94all without any external sensors requiring dedicated SPAN port traffic connections.\nEnterprise-grade management and automation. Substation operators are increasingly managing their substations as scaled IT assets, utilizing the deep knowledge and capabilities of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s industry-leading network security and management tools. The Catalyst IR8340 runs Cisco IOS-XE and builds upon this using Cisco DNA Center for automation, assurance, and compliance, as well as leveraging Cisco security features such as TrustSec, MACsec, 802.1x, VRF, VLAN, and Flexible NetFlow to the substation LAN via the built-in switching ports. As a Catalyst router it also delivers Cisco SD-WAN to the substation, so you can securely simplify deployment and management, as well as save costs by configuring SD-WAN to select the most relevant data transport path for different types of traffic.\nSupport for industry standard protocols. The Catalyst IR8340 supports many protocols relevant to the substation, including IEC62439-3 PRP & HSR for redundancy (the Catalyst IR8340 is acting as a PRP RedBox or HSR DANH), Cisco REP for ring topologies and multiple spanning tree variants. The timing module provides a direct GNSS connection and provides IEEE1588 PTP timing as a Grandmaster for the substation LAN, supporting C37.238 power profile and IEC61850-9-3 PUP. It supports widely used substation protocols such as IEC61850 (Layer 2 GOOSE, SV and layer 3 MMS), IEC104, DNP3, and Modbus, that are essential to substation operations. The Catalyst IR8340 natively supports serial connections via the serial interface module to provide either protocol translation (IEC101 to 104 and Serial DNP3 to DNP3 over IP) or tunneling of serial data across the network (using TCP/UDP Raw Sockets feature) allowing customers to support legacy serial assets while migrating to ethernet enabled devices. The Catalyst IR8340 also provides support for T1/E1 WAN connections via a network module for integration into existing SONET/SDH transport environments to ease the move to IP based technologies.\nApplication hosting and edge compute. Substation operators are looking for ways to run applications locally in their space-constrained substation rugged environments. The Catalyst IR8340 is designed with this need in mind and with support for Cisco IOx to power Cisco Cyber Vision and the utility\xe2\x80\x99s own applications within the substation. Examples include virtual RTUs, security applications, and many more.\nAdvantages of using the Catalyst IR8340 for next generation substation automation\nThe Catalyst IR8340 has something to offer for both IT and OT teams, with powerful automation tools available to suit either.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is a key component being validated as an integral part of the new Cisco Substation Automation validated Designs.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 provides connectivity and flexibility for now and the future with 4 expansion slots, so you can add 5G, P-LTE, FirstNet, 450Mhz, and future connectivity technologies, or additional storage or compute whenever it is needed. You will also have 4 copper, 4 combo, 4 SFP LAN ports, and 2 combo WAN ports at the ready.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 condenses multiple traditionally separate components into a single platform: WAN router, LAN switching with PRP/HSR/REP support, PTP Timing, and Security (Zone Based firewall, Cisco Cyber Vision Sensor).\nAnd it fits into the same rack space as the CGR2010!\nSo, for your next substation automation project, consider the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router and its flexible feature rich capabilities. You can start with simple use cases for secure connectivity and enable additional capabilities as your operational requirements evolve (e.g., enabling the Cisco Cyber Vision sensor, adding substation timing by adding the Timing Module or adding private or public cellular support via the range of 4G/5G Modules).\nLearn more\nCisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router Datasheet\nCisco.com/go/ir8300\nKeep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and\ninsights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nSubscribe to our Cisco IoT Newsletter\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Router Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Critical Infrastructure Utilities,"September 6, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/01/IL20220124192807-Marcus-Smith-150x150.jpg

25,Is it time to prod your roadways with a stick?,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\nThis is the first in a short series of blogs addressing the subjects: safer, smarter, and greener roadways. In this blog, I address \xe2\x80\x9csmarter\xe2\x80\x9d. We will take a look at the definition and discuss several aspects of smart roadways.\n  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  How do you know if your roadway is smart?\nIt is quite simple, prod it with a stick and see what happens! While this is a humorous approach, there is an underlying message.\nIf the roadway is smart, it will detect the prod and react appropriately. This implies that the roadway has both sensing capabilities and intelligence. Of course, the roadway doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make the decision itself, the sensing data needs to be sent back to the \xe2\x80\x9cbrain\xe2\x80\x9d or the traffic management center where an appropriate response can be defined. This gives an initial understanding of what a smart roadway is: sensors, high-speed telecommunications, decision-making, and command-and-control. But it is more than just technology elements.\nInteractive\nAs we apply technology elements, the roadway evolves from a passive resource into an interactive component of a framework that includes roadway, vehicle, driver, and management systems. It takes its place as a vital, active part of a systematic approach to traffic and mobility management. This is the first part of how I define \xe2\x80\x9csmart roadways\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the ability to be interactive.\nDisproportionate impact\nThe next part relates to the effects that smart roadways manifest. The obvious effects are improved safety, increased efficiency, enhanced user experience, minimized environmental effects, and improved equity. A less obvious and yet inherent quality of the operational technologies used in smart roadways is what we would call the \xe2\x80\x9cSun Tzu\xe2\x80\x9d effect. General Tzu was a famous Chinese general who lived around 500 BC. His book on military strategy, The Art of War, has been influencing military and strategic thinking ever since. In his book he said, \xe2\x80\x9csmall forces can achieve great things.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen you apply a small force at the right time, amazing effects can happen. The small force in this case is advanced transport technology in the form of Operational Technology or sharp end Information Technology designed to support real time traffic management.\nAnnual spending in Europe on advanced transport technology is about 5% of what is spent on asphalt, concrete, and steel. Yet the results significantly influence the performance of the conventional infrastructure. It is time to apply more \xe2\x80\x9csmall force\xe2\x80\x9d to get bigger results. Political goals have been set with respect to greenhouse gases and road traffic fatality reductions. These goals are not going to be attained with just asphalt, concrete, or steel. We need to add new infrastructure in form of operational technology, commonly referred to as a network.\nThese days, when we refer to roadway infrastructure, we are actually talking about two different things working in harmony, as a single system \xe2\x80\x93 the roadway infrastructure and the operational technology infrastructure. The small, new forces of operational technology will become critical to the successful operation of our transport network.\nShowing the signs of age\nThis brings us to another reason why the time is ripe for action. Much of the current operational technology network for traffic is aging. Not just in terms of hardware and software, but in terms of outdated architectures for connectivity and cybersecurity. Can you rely on it or is your network living on borrowed time? Being smart is also about being current.\nThe essence of smart roadways\nSo, if your roadway is smart then it will react appropriately when you prod it with a stick. It will have the sensing capabilities to detect threats and opportunities. It will also deliver the intelligence required to determine the appropriate response and timing of that response. Smart also includes the capability of the roadway to go beyond passive into a proactive, interactive component in a bigger system. And finally, smart embodies an inherent ability to do more with less. However, the most significant part of being smart lies in what you do with it. It is now time for us to harness the full power of smart roadways to help us to attain both our greenhouse gas and safety goals.\nSo, ask yourself this: Are your roadways and intersections smart enough for the road ahead? Is it time to consider an upgrade to operational technology and infrastructure?

The primary function of the iDMZ is the enforcement of a secure boundary between the internal trusted operations environment and external entities that may need to exchange data with services that support the operation.\nOne of the challenges with an exclusively on-site iDMZ is the limited ability around expansion to meet future demand and capabilities. With the growth of Industrial IoT (IIoT), it will be necessary for hardware and resource growth to meet the demands of increasing data. This translates to a consistently increasing hardware footprint and utilities to provide cooling and power, which can be in limited supply on premises. In addition, operators must explore new ways to obtain deeper insights and introduce enhancements to the operation, which may require tighter alignment with partners and/or the ability to securely consume XaaS offers.\nOperators also have a safety-first culture, keeping people out of the \xe2\x80\x9cline of fire.\xe2\x80\x9d Vendors and partners may need to maintain on-site hardware, applications and services, potentially exposing people to risk through their presence on-site. For heavy industry environments, accessibility to site and the equipment residing on it is not necessarily an easily accomplished task. Many industrial sites require site safety training and approved work permits as a prerequisite for physical access.\nFinally, a lack of iDMZ consistency when comparing multiple sites, from a hardware and feature composition, creates challenges for operations staff. In some instances, product and feature selection is made locally. This impacts the ability to deliver consistent policies and end user experiences. It also complicates support across the operation for staff responsible for troubleshooting and minimizing time to resolution and maintaining different SOPs and training documents.\nOperators exploring options to gain operational efficiencies through modern service offerings may benefit from exploring how to extend their iDMZ beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cfour walls\xe2\x80\x9d of the operation.\nOne deployment alternative for iDMZ is extending the architecture to leverage a hybrid-cloud model. A hybrid cloud iDMZ model can be deployed as a centralized model or repeated regionally, based on geographic presence and/or regulatory or compliance requirements. While migrating the entirety of the iDMZ and its capabilities to the cloud may not be an option, a hybrid cloud iDMZ architecture does offer operational benefits and mitigates previously raised challenges.\nFirst, the hybrid cloud iDMZ can secure the operation, and mitigate risk and exposure. Similar to an on-prem iDMZ, multiple tools and applications should be leveraged to take a holistic approach for enforcing security. This can include:\nServices that support a secure and encrypted pipe between an operations site and a regional iDMZ\nSegmentation and possible options for multi-tenancy\nVisibility to monitor applications and flows traversing the industrial zone\nThe solution should also include tools for consistently configuring, deploying, enforcing policies, and managing assets.\nIn addition to providing a holistic security strategy, a hybrid cloud iDMZ offers the benefit of shared resources and assets, as opposed to entirely duplicating unique stand-alone iDMZ deployments per site. The regional based approach offers a more repeatable and consistent architecture, delivering consistent policies, as well as easing the operational overhead and complexity mentioned previously.\nA hybrid cloud solution offers more flexibility to expand, and contract based on evolving requirements and demand. By leveraging public cloud services as part of the iDMZ architecture, operators have the ability to increase capabilities without physically maintaining hardware and space to house equipment. This approach affords the unique opportunity to foster tighter engagements with partners and ecosystem vendors, while leveraging cloud services to drive innovation, deeper operational insights and efficiencies. Adding tools like Thousand Eyes and App Dynamics, operators can verify adherence to application SLAs/SLOs, in accordance with operational requirements.\nFinally, a hybrid cloud iDMZ aligns with the concept of the ROC (Regional Operations Center), which is top of mind for some industrial organizations, especially those with a global footprint. A ROC model seeks to leverage more automation and remote operations, thus reducing on-site headcount to mission essential resources, improving on-site safety and driving more operational efficiencies. With a regional based iDMZ deployment, the process of aggregating and presenting the status and data for operations within the region can become more streamlined and a regionally distributed model can facilitate compliance with local industry regulations, if applicable.\nFor more details on how to build a hybrid cloud iDMZ architecture and its benefits for securing industrial operations, we have just published a short white paper that you should read on the Hybrid Cloud Industrial DMZ. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also be discussing this in a free webinar on September 20, 2022.\nWatch the webinar replay Hybrid Cloud iDMZ.\nTo learn more about how you can secure your industrial infrastructure, visit our industrial security page or contact us to have a conversation around your industrial IoT security challenges.\nWant the latest industry news on IoT security delivered straight to your inbox?\nSubscribe to the Cisco IoT/OT Security Newsletter\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Secure Firewall firewall management Industrial IoT (IIoT) Manufacturing Mining network security Oil and Gas,"August 23, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Kevin-Turek-150x150.png
27,Extend your enterprise SDWAN to the new industrial outdoor routers,Nipun Jain,"b'Are you looking to be a jack of all trades with your Utility network? Look no further! With the new Cisco SD-WAN capabilities that combine IoT features with enterprise networks it is now easier than ever to extend your carpeted space to the outdoors and rugged indoor environments, and make it one large, cohesive, and easy to manage network! IoT Utility customers are beginning to realize the value of managing the WAN network using a decentralized controller-based model. The advantages of this model are many-fold. Cisco SD-WAN excels in connecting enterprise devices (routers and platforms) securely to apply an \xe2\x80\x9capplication first\xe2\x80\x9d paradigm to policy and control plane management, i.e., devices can only communicate with destinations consistent with their role and security posture.\nWith the new features in Cisco SDWAN version 20.7 we can now extend the concept of the extended enterprise based on the SDWAN network to IoT Utility AMI (Advanced Metering Infrastructure) networks. What are IoT AMI networks you may ask? These are mesh networks of millions of connected, IPv6 enabled smart metering and monitoring equipment. These new smart meters are enabling insights into the electric grid and providing a proactive approach to managing the electric grid, including providing early outage alerts and data related to the network management of these meters. Our SD-WAN customers would also like to extend all the upsides of an SDWAN managed head-end to the IoT-AMI network for a one-two punch combo!\nThese networks thus far have been managed by a single management platform \xe2\x80\x93 the Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND). With SDWAN thrown into the mix for customers already using the Cisco SDWAN platform we are now able to construct a hybrid model with the AMI network managed by FND and the Head-End network managed by the Controller in Cisco SDWAN \xe2\x80\x93 vManage. To learn more, read the whitepaper providing details of the solution as a starting and strategy guide for deploying and extending your enterprise network to Rugged and non-carpeted spaces by leveraging industrial IoT routing.\nShare'",Tags: Advanced Metering Infrastructure Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco IoT Field Network Director Utilities,"August 18, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/04/Nipun-Jain-150x150.jpg
28,ARC Advisory: Cisco leads in industrial networking,Samuel Pasquier,"b'A few weeks ago, Cisco sponsored the 26th ARC Industry Forum, and it was truly a pleasure to be back together in person. We enjoyed meeting with leaders from various industrial sectors. They shared with us how the pandemic exacerbated their need for digital transformation.\nThe challenges and opportunities of digitizing industries \xe2\x80\x93 including manufacturing, power utilities, oil and gas, public transportation, mining and more \xe2\x80\x93 were top of mind for everyone. Organizations are accelerating deployment of even more IT innovations into their industrial operations. Among their goals are to increase agility, enable remote and hybrid work, and drive productivity, profitability, and safety.\nCisco is best known for its leading IT networking and security solutions, fewer know that we have also been developing products that meet the specific needs of these industries for more than 15 years. The ARC Industry Forum highlighted an exciting milestone: the ARC Advisory naming Cisco the market leader in industrial ethernet switches. This industry analyst recognition builds on momentum from 2021, when Forrester Research named Cisco a leader in industrial control systems (ICS) security solutions.\nWe offer a unique combination of a leading networking portfolio, comprehensive industrial security solution and deep expertise in operational technology (OT) constraints and use cases. Every day, industrial organizations leverage Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s strengths to securely accelerate their digitization projects.\nDuring the conference, I had a chance to sit down with Sid Snitkin, VP, Cybersecurity Services at ARC Advisory. We covered drivers and challenges of digital transformation in industrial environments, pressing cybersecurity concerns for industrial networks, and the importance of strong partnerships between IT and OT in any industrial organization.\nI encourage you to watch the short video below and then reach out to explore how we can help you overcome your industrial networking challenges.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Industrial IoT (IIoT) Manufacturing Utilities,"August 17, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607113527-Samuel-Pasquier-150x150.jpg
29,Optimize and secure transit fleet management with visibility to connected devices and secure remote access,John Szpak,"b'Children have been singing \xe2\x80\x9cThe wheels on the bus go round and round\xe2\x80\x9d since 1939. What\xe2\x80\x99s new today is the tech that keeps those wheels rolling safely and on schedule.\nTransit fleet operators work towards achieving on-time performance and vehicle reliability in order to attain safety, cost, and ridership goals. That requires deploying new technologies to improve operational efficiency and predictability. Who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like a bus service that\xe2\x80\x99s on-time, reliable, safe to ride and has other perks such as free WiFi?\nSome ways transit fleet operators are increasing operational efficiency include leveraging vehicle telematics, remotely connected devices in the vehicle, real-time vehicle location, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Together these devices and information provide critical data to the operations center via the Cisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series cellular and Wi-Fi router.\nSome of the connected devices on buses today include:\nComputer-aided dispatch and automatic vehicle location (CAD/AVL). These transmit route and real-time location information so dispatchers can see if the bus is on time, ahead or behind schedule.\nVehicle telematics to monitor engine temperature, oil pressure, emissions, fuel economy, etc. in support of predictive maintenance.\nFare collection systems for plastic card or mobile payment.\nPassenger counting, which is useful for route capacity planning and complying with pandemic-related occupancy restrictions.\nIP security cameras that capture video triggered by events like doors opening and closing or the driver pressing a distress button in the event of a disturbance.\nVoice communications between the driver and dispatch center.\nOperational efficiency takes a hit whenever one of these connected devices, IoT sensors or the vehicle telematics system stops working because buses are often simply taken out of service when issues like these are reported. If the CAD/AVL system goes offline, for example, the fleet operator can\xe2\x80\x99t provide accurate ETAs to passengers on digital signs and online schedules. Loss of the fare collection system results in revenue loss for the transit agency as passengers ride for free. Loss of a video camera feed might prevent the counting of passengers or visibility of a potential safety threat as passengers enter and exit the bus. And an outage on a vehicle telematics system might result in a breakdown that could have been detected and prevented\xe2\x80\x94inconveniencing passengers and requiring the operator to assign an on-call driver and replacement vehicle to take over the route. That\xe2\x80\x99s costly and inconvenient. As fleet operators grow and the number of vehicles that need to be supported increases, these issues are further magnified.\nVisibility and secure equipment access boost operational efficiency\nNow, fleet operators can quickly detect, assess, and fix problems with connected equipment using the Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. It\xe2\x80\x99s a modular cloud service with a simple user interface to help operations teams view important data about the health and operational status of connected equipment and sensors, using the IR1800 cellular Wi-Fi router (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1 \xe2\x80\x93 IoT Operations Dashboard\nIn the figure above, each dot represents a transit bus. A red dot indicates that one of the connected devices on the bus is malfunctioning. One click shows which system has the problem\xe2\x80\x94such as an offline fare payment system, security camera or passenger counting system. With one click, the operator can learn about the status of connected devices on the bus as well as the router.\nWith another click the operator can learn more about the failing device and open a remote session to the device, using one of several industry standard protocols, to diagnose the problem or view the device details \xe2\x80\x93 providing a fast solution to many problems.\nSecure equipment access protects sensitive data from intruders\nIoT security is top of mind for critical infrastructure like transportation systems, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed IoT Operations Dashboard with Secure Equipment Access (SEA) to connected equipment on the bus. Using this SEA capability, transit Operator employees, or third-party service technicians log into the IoT Operations Dashboard with multi-factor authentication through their browser and use it for remote access to connected devices using common protocols such as SSH, RDP, VNC, HTTP, or serial terminal interfaces, and can even use a native desktop application. And all communication is encrypted over the cellular & Wi-Fi router, preventing unauthorized access (see figure below). This is the essence and power of secure remote access. Lastly, the IoT Operations Dashboard enables operations teams to securely meet the scale demands of today\xe2\x80\x99s fleet operators.\nFigure 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Secure Equipment Access (SEA) schematic\nTo sum up, the payoff for being able to securely view, monitor, and troubleshoot all bus connected devices, and IoT sensors from one interface is increased operational efficiency and lower costs. It\xe2\x80\x99s simpler than ever to make sure \xe2\x80\x9cthe doors on the bus go open and shut, all around the town.\xe2\x80\x9d On time, and safely.\nLearn more\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard\nCisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series cellular and Wi-Fi router\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s Mass Transit approach\nSubscribe to our Cisco IoT Newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Sensors Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Connected Fleet Featured Remote Access Transportation,"August 16, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/John-Szpak-150x150.png
30,Why Manufacturers duplicate IPv4 addresses and how IE switches help solve the issues,Albert Mitchell,"b'If this topic piqued your interest, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably impacted by or at least curious about duplicate IP Addresses in your industrial network. You are not alone. It can be a little bewildering. There doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be any reason in this day and age to have duplicate IP Addresses, let alone do it on purpose. Let\xe2\x80\x99s unravel the mystery.\nCompanies that build sophisticated machines have made the transition to Internet Protocol as the communication protocol within their machines. IPv4 is the easiest protocol to use. There are lots of software libraries in the ether based on IPv4. These companies\xe2\x80\x99 core competency is the electrical and mechanical aspect of their machines, not the software that runs the machine and therefore they do not have sophisticated software teams. When you\xe2\x80\x99re writing communication software and software is not your core competency, what is the easiest and least problematic way to identify the components within your machine? Answer: Static IP Addresses. The alternative to static IP Addresses is a more complicated process involving dynamic IP Address assignment, along with a complex task of identifying which IP Address the individual components received.\nThe IP Addresses were duplicated on purpose. The software in the machine uses static IP Addresses to identify individual machine components because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for the machine builders. Each machine they build has the same software (SW). Therefore, they use the same static IP Addresses. If you have purchased two or more of their machines, then you have duplicate IP Addresses. To be fair, it would be much harder and cost prohibitive to give each component of each machine a unique IP Address.\nFigure 1: Robots represent multiple machines with identical components and software\nThe robots in the picture above are an example of a sophisticated machine. Each robot has the same components and the same software. Each component has its own statically assigned IP Address. This practice is not restricted to robots. Bottling machines and diaper making machines are manufactured in the same way.\nWhy is this a problem?\nAs long as you can contain the broadcasts of IPv4 Addresses of the components to stay within the machine, you should be OK. There\xe2\x80\x99s always one publicly unique IPv4 address on the machine which represents the entire machine to the outside world. Again, as long as you only use this one IPv4 address to communicate with the machine, it should not present any problems. Most of the time this is how it\xe2\x80\x99s done and everyone is happy.\nAlong comes the need to increase productivity. To increase productivity, you need more data. And where is this data? One place is inside the machine. Now you need to communicate with the components inside the machine. Once you have more than one machine, how should you communicate with the internal components that have the same IPv4 address? This is the problem.\nSolutions\nBefore describing solutions, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to uplevel the discussion to talk about Network Address Translation (NAT) in general.\nEverybody should know about NAT. We use NAT every day whether we know it or not. The IPv4 router in our homes uses NAT. The IP Address assigned to your home devices (including your laptop and smartphone) is a private IP Address. This private IP Address is not routable on the Internet. Our neighbors all have in home devices with the same IPv4 addresses. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem because our home routers use Network Address Translation (NAT) to convert private IP Addresses to a publicly routable IP Address so we can communicate with devices on the Internet. The Internet service providers use private IP Addresses for in home use because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for them. There are not enough IPv4 addresses in the world for every IP capable device to have a unique IPv4 address. And let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, we have not converted to IPv6.\nYour home is not the only place NAT is used. Industrial networks also need to use NAT because sophisticated machines have the same IPv4 addresses.\nThere are really only two ways to solve duplicate addressing problems for industrial networks. The most obvious way is to insert an additional Layer 3 device such as a firewall or router between the machine and the rest of the network\xe2\x80\x94just to translate Private IP Addresses. This is similar to what you have at home. This solution requires a special network device for the purpose to convert private IPv4 addresses to publicly unique IPv4 addresses. The drawback is, that it\xe2\x80\x99s an additional device to purchase and manage and, configuration and management of this Layer 3 network device can be complex, requiring someone with IT skills to setup and maintain them.\nThe less obvious way is to use a Cisco Industrial Ethernet (IE) switch to do the IPv4 translation. When the IE switch solves the duplicate IP addressing problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s using Layer 2 NAT. Plus, in my biased opinion, configuring Layer 2 NAT on a Cisco IE switch is easier than configuring NAT on router or firewall. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably an Industrial Ethernet switch in your network already connecting all the machines together. Why introduce an additional network device? Keep the same simple network architecture you have with a Cisco IE switch and solve your duplicate IPv4 addressing issues, too.\nFigure 2: IE-4010 connecting multiple complex machines\nIn figure 2 above, each robot has the same IP Addresses for its internal components. The Cisco IE switch will translate the duplicated private IP addresses of the components of each robot (ie: complex machine) into publicly unique IP Addresses as it receives the Ethernet frames from the robots.\nSample IOS CLI configuration for the Cisco Industrial Ethernet\nThis is how you would configure a Cisco Industrial Ethernet switch to provide L2NAT for the first two robots on the left in Figure 2. The remaining three robots would be very similar to the first two.\nYou start by defining which IPv4 Addresses to translate. The Cisco IE does not know which publicly or private IP addresses you want to use. You have to tell it. You define the complete translation.\nDefine a translation instance for each robot. The \xe2\x80\x98leftmost\xe2\x80\x99 robot would have this translation instance for 3 of its internal components. The \xe2\x80\x98nextleftmost\xe2\x80\x99 robot would have the same private IP Addresses but unique public IP addresses.\nNote: The IP Addresses for the inside hosts are the same in each of the two translation instances, and the translated public IP Addresses are unique. They have to be unique if they are to be used in the upstream network to uniquely identify the robot components.\nThe next step in the configuration process is to apply the translation instances to the correct interface. The \xe2\x80\x98leftmost\xe2\x80\x99 robot is connected to port Gi1/2, and the robot next to it is connected to Gi1/4.\nDisclaimer: This configuration, while valid, is just an example.\nWhen it comes to configuring anything in the IOS CLI, the example above shows how simple it can be. For those of you who do not like using the IOS CLI, the same configuration can be done using the IE\xe2\x80\x99sweb based GUI.\nConclusion\nFor those of you looking for a solution to the duplicate IP Addressing problem, using the IE switch you already have in place just makes sense. For those you without an IE Switch, now you have an excuse to deploy one in the access layer. Especially if you have unmanaged switches in the access layer today. Using an IE switch is a one box solution. The IE switches do the IPv4 address translation at line rate. They also translate the IPv4 addresses in the payload for ICMP and ARP.\nL2 NAT is just one of the many features on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IE switching solutions that solve customer issues with quality and reliability.\nGet more information on Layer 2 NAT\nCisco IE Switch configuration guides have a chapter on Layer 2 NAT.

31,Securing your operations? Don’t forget your hardware,Vivek Bhargava,"b'When you think about cybersecurity, I bet you think about protection from malware \xe2\x80\x93 pieces of software that can infiltrate industrial resources and steal data or disrupt operations. Such security requires sophisticated firewalls, deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and prevention, and a robust network that can segment operations and limit any malware\xe2\x80\x99s spread.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s great, but you might be ignoring vulnerabilities that can arise from deficiencies in the underlying hardware. If you are, you would be making a grave error. If the hardware is not reliable, any security measures you take on the network and resources that run on that hardware can\xe2\x80\x99t be relied upon. Securing the hardware should be considered fundamental to securing operations.\nThe hardware can be a source of vulnerabilities\nCompromised hardware may have counterfeit products that have a higher risk of downtime, backdoors, logic bombs, built-in malware and spyware, inferior components, and greater potential for denial-of-service attacks. Such hardware could be ticking time bombs.\nVery recently, a CEO of dozens of companies was charged in a scheme to traffic an estimated $1 Billion in fraudulent and counterfeit Cisco networking equipment. The chargesheet reads\xe2\x80\x94among other allegations\xe2\x80\x94that the counterfeiters added, \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized, low-quality, or unreliable components \xe2\x80\x93 including components to circumvent technological measures added by Cisco to the software to check for software license compliance and to authenticate the hardware.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a leading provider of enterprise and industrial networking and security products, we at Cisco are committed to ensuring that our networking equipment is hardened and provides that secure stable base that you can rely to build your mission critical operations upon.\nIEC 62443 \xe2\x80\x93 Cybersecurity for industrial operations\nThe Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) industry has developed a comprehensive framework that lays out the best practices for robust industrial cybersecurity for both vendors and users. This framework considers measures against both software and hardware-based attacks and was initially developed by the International Society of Automation (ISA) as the ISA99 standards. The International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) subsequently built on that work and produced IEC 62443 set of standards. As shown in the diagram, the standard consists of four building blocks \xe2\x80\x93 each of which is a standard in itself.\nFigure 1: IEC 62443 set of standards\nWe have previously written about the various parts of this wide-ranging standard. For example, see: What is ISA/IEC 62443 and the fact that Cisco has received certifications for IEC 62443. In this blog, I will describe how security is built into the complete lifecycle of our entire industrial networking equipment portfolio that complies with the IEC 62443-4 part of the standard. IEC 62443-4 consists of two parts as described below.\nISA/IEC 62443-4-1: Secure product development lifecycle requirements\nThe first part, IEC 62443-4-1, describes how the underlying products must be developed so that they meet required security standards considerations.\nIEC 62443-4-1 describes requirements for the secure development of products used to assemble IACS as well as maturity levels to set benchmarks for compliance. These requisites include requirement, management, design, coding guidelines, implementation, verification and validation, defect management, patch management and product end-of-life. All of these are essential to the security capabilities of a component and the underlying secure-by-design approach of the IACS solution. The overall focus is on continuous improvement in product development and release.\nCisco software and hardware products are developed according to the Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL), which enforces a secure-by-design philosophy from product planning through end-of-life.\nCSDL comprehensively addresses security from planning, operating, and monitoring stages.\nPlan: Extensive threat modeling and assessments help us to build security and privacy into our technology right from the start rather than bolt it on afterwards.\nDevelop: We use secure coding standards, threat-resistant code, and follow security best practices. Extensive code reviews prevent defects and minimize security weaknesses.\nValidate: Our testing regimen incorporates industry-leading protocol tests, open-source and commercial tools, and sophisticated application test methods for vulnerability and penetration testing.\nLaunch: Our strict pre-launch criteria tests readiness and prepares the product for customer use.\nOperate: Our security preparedness does not stop at product launch. Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) team monitors security events, coordinates fixes, and sends notification to customers.\nMonitor: Cisco Talos threat intelligence group research potential threats and shares actionable information with the broader security community to build better defenses.\nISA/IEC 62443 4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS components\nIEC 62443-4-2 contains requirements for components necessary to provide the required security base for 62443-3 and higher levels.\nIn this regard, the standard specifies security capabilities that enable hardware equipment to be integrated into a secure IACS deployment. Part 4-2 contains requirements for four types of components: software application, embedded device, host device, and network device. In essence, a secure IACS solution needs to be built based on secure components.\nThe upper-layer recommendations, such as IEC 62443-3-3, assume that secure components will be deployed to meet the corresponding requirements that address the current and future vulnerability and threat landscape.\nSeveral Cisco products have already achieved IEC 62443-4-2 certification. In combination with a 62443-certified development process (CSDL), Cisco offers trustworthy communication products which are essential for IACS deployment in critical infrastructures.\nCisco Trustworthy Technologies\nIn addition to benefiting from secure development methodologies, Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches contain several embedded security features that provide additional layers of protection. These include the Trust Anchor Module that authenticates hardware for immutable device identity and secure storage, among others. These switches also feature Secure Boot that ensures that only authentic and unmodified software boots up on them, Signed Images that protect against insertion of counterfeit and tampered software, and Runtime Defenses that protect running devices from attacks that change product software execution.\nOur commitment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end here\nNot only does Cisco build products that comply with existing industrial networking and security standards (such as IEC 61850 for utilities) but also help move them forward with active participation and leadership in IEC, ISA, IEEE, and other standard-setting bodies.\nFor further reading, please refer to the following:\nThe Cisco Trust Center\nCisco Trustworthy Solutions\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Talos ISA/IEC 62443,"July 20, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/1534946365-bpfull.jpg

This means that cybersecurity starts right at the edge of the network.\nRussell, recalls, \xe2\x80\x9cCisco worked with us, as a key technology partner, right from the beginning, to help us create an architecture that would enable FMCI to deliver the cutting-edge scenarios our customers need \xe2\x80\x93 all of which is underpinned by the latest generation of networking.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFlexible networking\nRussell knew he wanted a network that could offer customers a variety of connectivity options; including wired copper and fiber, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, 4G, 5G, V2X, and specialized seamless 5GHz wireless for vehicles within the Shannon Freezone business park where FMCI is located, and I am delighted to report that Cisco was able to help FMCI achieve these objectives.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA software-defined network was critical for us\xe2\x80\x9d, says Wassim. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ability to drive business intent into the network, with APIs allowing us to be agile, to create and destroy network overlays and segments in a highly automated way; Cisco Software-Defined Access does exactly this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCisco Software-Defined Access (SDA) managed via Cisco DNA Center, is a great fit for FMCI. It creates network segmentation at L2 and L3, right from the data center to the roadside. With Cisco Catalyst 9000 switches and Wi-Fi access points in the carpeted space, and Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series Switches at the roadside, providing connectivity and often Power over Ethernet (PoE) too, for everything at street level.\nRemote access to the mules to bring in remote experts\n\xe2\x80\x98Mule\xe2\x80\x99 is the rather undignified name, used in the industry to describe highly customized and specialized test vehicles. FMCI currently has two mules: a Jaguar I-PACE and a Land Rover Defender.\nWhile it was important to have VPNs over the cellular connections, FMCI needed a VPN-less way of allowing their customers to securely connect directly into the mules. \xe2\x80\x9cCustomers may be onsite with us here in Shannon, Ireland, but many are remote and/or they bring in remote experts\xe2\x80\x9d, says Wassim. He continues, \xe2\x80\x9cwe wanted the security of a VPN, as we\xe2\x80\x99re often helping customers with commercially sensitive research and development, but without the complexity and setup overhead of a traditional VPN.\xe2\x80\x9d To address this need, Wassim and I set up Secure Equipment Access with the Cisco Catalyst IR1835 Rugged Series Router managed in Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. This allows FMCI to enable secure remote access sessions, with specific equipment in the mule vehicles, over HTTP/S, SSH, RDP & VNC, for selected internal or external users. And those users can connect from anywhere in the world with just a web browser!\nBoth mules needed identical networking setups to include:\nA rugged router that could connect to both 4G and 5G simultaneously. The router needed to be able to create a Wi-Fi bubble within the vehicle, build VPN tunnels back to the FMCI corporate network, and also communicate with the vehicles themselves via the CAN bus. They selected the Cisco IR1835, which was a perfect fit.\nA switch that could operate fanless and still deliver 10Gbps port performance (a single automotive camera generates over 7Gbps of raw traffic!), and that could help propagate precision time (IEEE-1588 PTP) throughout the vehicle, to maintain synchronization across the specialized automotive equipment. To address these requirements, they selected the Cisco Industrial Ethernet 5000 Series Switch.\nEverything, and more\nRussell told me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe needed multi-access, software-defined, and robust cyber security. Cisco has delivered, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to our continued partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d I can only agree and am really excited by the innovative work FMCI are doing and also about what is to come.\nAnd today I am proud to be celebrating the formal launch and opening of FMCI, with T\xc3\xa1naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) of Ireland\xe2\x80\x94Leo Varadkar TD, Michael Timmeny, SVP & Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Government Strategy Officer, and Shane Heraty, Regional Director for Cisco Ireland and Scotland.\nFMCI was founded with the sole purpose of creating and delivering future mobility testbed facilities to stimulate research, development and innovation in the area of Connected, Autonomous, Shared and Electric, including Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, in Ireland. Their Cisco network provides a multi-access, segmented and secure fabric to directly support this innovation. And I am delighted to have been part of the Cisco team that has helped FMCI achieve these goals.\nLearn more\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard\nCisco Software-Defined Access (SDA)\nCisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series Switches\nCisco Industrial Ethernet 5000 Series Switches\nCisco Catalyst IR1835 Rugged Series Router\nSecure Equipment Access\nCisco Zero Trust Networks\nCisco Meraki Smart Cameras\nCisco IoT Solutions for Connected Roadways and Intersections\nCisco Connected Communities\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series Cisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Ethernet 5000 Series Switches Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Roadways Smart Cities Transportation Wireless Backhaul,"July 15, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/IL20220711165719-pkavanag-150x150.jpeg
33,Benefits and challenges in deploying Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC),Wei Zou,"b'According to the UITP World Metro Figures 2021 report, approximately 3,300 km of new rail infrastructure was put in service between the start of 2018 and the end of 2020. This represents an infrastructure growth of 25% globally. During this timeframe, operational fleets worldwide increased by 28,000 vehicles to a total of 140,000 vehicles. In 2019, an average of 190 million passengers per day were taking the metro globally. This is an increase of 20% compared to five years ago. Rail operators are constantly striving to keep their trains moving safely, providing superior and reliable services to the riders, and lowering their operational cost.\nLegacy fixed block signaling systems\xe2\x80\x94a system that uses signals to prevent a train from entering an occupied fixed section of track\xe2\x80\x94can no longer meet the increasing demands. A modern railway signaling system called \xe2\x80\x9cCommunications-based train control (CBTC)\xe2\x80\x9d was introduced in the mid 1980s with the objective to achieve maximum capacity while maintaining the safety requirements. CBTC is mainly used in urban railway lines and automated people movers (APM), although it can be deployed on commuter lines.\nWhat is CBTC?\nAs defined in IEEE Std 1474.1, \xe2\x80\x9cCBTC system is a continuous, automatic train control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and train-borne and wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKey Benefits of CBTC\nHere are some key benefits that CBTC brings to the rail operators:\nImproved safety: With implementation of CBTC, the location of the train can be determined with a high degree of accuracy, independent of track circuits. The speed of a train can be regulated to protect trains against collision, excessive speed, and maintain the safe braking distance and train separation. With additional functions such as programmed stopping, door control, route interlocking, work zone protection, and highway grade-crossing warning, accidents and hazardous conditions can be significantly reduced.\nMaximize capacity: The key objective of deploying CBTC is to allow rail operators to better utilize their railway infrastructure, maximize the capacity by keeping the headway between operating trains at minimum while maintaining the safety requirements.\nEnhanced passenger experience: CBTC enables trains to run closer together at higher speed, meaning faster services to the riders. With increased precision of train location information, the accuracy of real-time arrival information can be improved significantly. And thanks to CBTC, riders can enjoy smoother rides because acceleration and braking are controlled by the system so passengers can expect more consistency in terms of train operation.\nReduced CapEx and OpEx: As CBTC technology evolves, the system becomes more compact, and architecture is getting simpler. This means less equipment at wayside that is easier to implement and maintain. Moreover, these systems allow rail operators to monitor trains and adjust the performance level of individual trains to maintain schedule. The CBTC system provides flexibility to the rail operators to respond to schedule changes and emergencies more efficiently.\nImproved sustainability: CBTC enables different levels of Grades of Automation (GoA) and has proven to be more energy efficient than traditional manual operation. With automatic speed regulation provided by the system, unnecessary acceleration and braking are not required, which leads to big energy saving. With reduced power consumption and less air pollution, environmental sustainability is improved.\nKey networking challenges to consider\nAlthough CBTC brings tremendous benefits to the rail operator, there are some key networking challenges the rail operator needs to consider when deploying this solution:\nUltra-reliable train-to-wayside wireless communication: Successful operation relies on reliable bi-directional train-to-wayside wireless communication when trains operate at high speed. Mission critical systems like CBTC should be designed to achieve network latency less than 500 msec, wireless handover time of less than 50 msec, and less than 0.1 percent packet loss. Other physical parameters that cause poor wireless connectivity need to be carefully studied. These include lack of line of sight, electromagnetic interference, channel interference, spectrum congestion, and limitation of physical environment for radio and antenna installation. Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul radios and Cisco Catalyst IW9167 Series outdoor access points are designed to provide reliable wireless connectivity for any application, anywhere.\nResilient and high available onboard and trackside infrastructure: The CBTC system is composed of five major sub-systems in general: train-to-wayside communication system, CBTC onboard equipment, wayside equipment, backbone network, and control center. Depending on the supplier, the architecture can be either centralized or distributed. Due to the criticality of the system, network redundancy and high availability must be taken into consideration during the system design phase, and good tools are required for network management, automation, provisioning, service assurance, policy, and security implementation. Check out Cisco Connected Communities Infrastructure (CCI) Solution Design Guide for details about designing wayside infrastructure for rail operation.\nCybersecurity: Digitization of rail operation requires strong cybersecurity. Attacks on vital rail systems can cause train stoppages, unsatisfactory rider experiences, and could potentially even cost lives when trains derail or collide. Experience has shown that a strategy of trying to simply \xe2\x80\x9cair-gap\xe2\x80\x9d and isolate operational networks does not prevent attacks. A comprehensive, systematic, and coordinated approach is needed. Challenges such as the following need to be considered: only authorized users and devices are connecting to the network, users and systems can access only data and services for which they are authorized, users are not connecting to malicious sites, malware is not brought into systems, and only legitimate traffic is transiting the network. Robust tools are needed to manage profiles and policies at scale and monitor those users and devices on the network to ensure compliance with those policies. All of this must be done in a way that enables a quick response to new threats and intrusions as they emerge.\nIntrigued?

34,Data powers “wow” experiences at Cisco Live 2022,Patty Medberry,"b'Cars in constant conversation with road sensors. Autonomous vehicles. Progress toward zero emissions. These are just a few highlights of digital transformation showcased at Cisco Live, held June 12-16, 2022. I and my fellow attendees\xe2\x80\x94in person and virtual\xe2\x80\x94were treated to example after example of \xe2\x80\x9cwow\xe2\x80\x9d experiences both here today and coming tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 all powered by data. These experiences are based using the network as a \xe2\x80\x9cdigital nervous system.\xe2\x80\x9d It senses by connecting cameras, IoT sensors and systems. It transmits this sensed data to the brain (applications at the edge or cloud). And it delivers amazing experiences back out to us humans. Here are a few of my favorite examples from Cisco Live on how digital transformation will create new possibilities.\nNew business models\nWe heard from Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company and Darren Palmer, Vice President of Electric Vehicle Programs for Ford Model e. Both Farley and Palmer talked about how Ford is transforming the customer relationship from discrete events to something that happens every day. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine a world where vehicles get data from a network of sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Palmer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re embedded in the roadways or the intersections, even buried within the concrete \xe2\x80\xa6 This digital transformation stands to completely change the relationship with our customers, redefining our business model, and giving us a path to the future. The network is key to help make this 20-year vision a reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSafer roads and cities\nWe heard more about the role of IoT data in transportation safety from Tim Slusser, Chief of Mobility Innovation for the City of Detroit. Pointing out that for every accident there are many more near misses, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHaving access to and sharing real-time data will let our citizens know when and where these hazards and risks exist. And it will let us predict and possibly prevent them in the future. This could not only change the way that cities and roads are run, it could positively impact the environment, congestion, and ultimately it will help save lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe saw the possibility of what a \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork of sensors\xe2\x80\x9d means in various Cisco Live demos. In one demo, a car received an alert when a pedestrian stepped into an upcoming crosswalk. In another, an ambulance overrode normal traffic light timing to create a \xe2\x80\x9cgreen corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d saving precious minutes.\nImproved efficiencies and customer experiences via a \xe2\x80\x9cRolling data center\xe2\x80\x9d\nMany attendees flocked to the session on \xe2\x80\x9cExtending Wireless and 5G to Next-Generation Buses,\xe2\x80\x9d with Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) of Columbus, Ohio. Organizations like COTA are connecting their buses to the network to collect telemetry information (say, for predictive maintenance) and to attract riders with reliable Wi-Fi. But progress has been limited because bus mechanics generally aren\xe2\x80\x99t trained in installing and maintaining wireless gateways. COTA overcame that problem with Cisco industrial gateways. Through the Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, the process of installing and integrating the routers on the bus has evolved. Technicians install the router, power it up, and through Plug and Play the router reaches out to the Operations Dashboard for automated configuration. Additionally, as cyber security continues to become crucial to businesses in all sectors, COTA will leverage technologies such as Cisco Cyber Vision to protect against today\xe2\x80\x99s and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s cyberthreats. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have created a rolling data center and finally integrated the operational technology and IT experience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sophia Mohr, COTA\xe2\x80\x99s Chief Innovation and Technology Officer.\nChain reaction across industries\nOne industry\xe2\x80\x99s digital transformation can be so significant that it can cause chain reactions across adjacent industries, bringing even more benefits. Autonomous vehicles, as an example, could also mean changes to the insurance industry, to first responders, and suppliers to name a few. And those are just the transportation examples. Similar stories of digital transformation are happening in utilities, mining, manufacturing, ports, and other industries.\nImagining the possibilities\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t even pretend to imagine all the ways that data will change our lives for the better. Some applications my team has been exploring include new business models based on software as a service (SaaS). Improving safety by detecting problems (machine problems, road hazards) and taking action before harm occurs. Realizing zero emissions by reducing congestion and time on the road. And increasing efficiencies with better insights and autonomous operations. The common theme in all of these innovations is the network\xe2\x80\x94the digital nervous system working behind the scenes to sense information, move it up to the cloud or out to the edge, and deliver great experiences back to the people.\nCheck out how Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT portfolio brings together the industrial network, data, and security to deliver our next generation experiences.\nHow has data changed your company or industry over the last three years? How do you expect it to change over the next five? We\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear from you \xe2\x80\x93 drop us a line in the comments below.\n  Subscribe to our IoT newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things\ntrends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: 5G Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Network Automation Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Sensors Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Live Cisco Live 2022 Connected Roadways Featured Smart Cities,"July 12, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg
35,An insider’s guide to Cisco Live 2022: don’t miss these top 7 IoT highlights,Patty Medberry,"b'Much has changed since the last in-person Cisco Live, in 2019. Hybrid work is a household term. Some of us are better cooks. And the industrial internet of things (IoT) has taken giant leaps, transforming industries like manufacturing, ports, mining, transportation, utilities, and governments.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re excited to share the latest innovations in industrial IoT at Cisco Live 2022, to be held in Las Vegas from June 12-16, 2022. Here are my picks for what to check out during an action-packed event. And if you are not able to attend, there are a lot of ways to participate remotely.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 See a network running under water\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that in the water tank? Is it a 1RU fish? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s our newest Cisco Catalyst IW9167E heavy duty access point\xe2\x80\x94proof that our industrial networks can withstand to just about anything. Our industrial networking products are deployed in the most demanding conditions, including rain, wind, dust, vibration, and extreme temperatures. Deploy our industrial switches, routers, gateways, and access points in harsh environments like utility substations, factory assembly lines, ports, mines, and roadways. Visit the World of Solutions to have a look at new products like the Catalyst IW9167E, which is IP67-rated.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Check out a Dallara AV-21 autonomous racecar\nLook out for a Dallara AV-21 racecar that competed at the Indy Autonomous Challenge in October 2021. These autonomous cars whipped around the track and broke world records at speeds up to 192.2 mph. Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (Cisco URWB) wirelessly connects these race cars and helps to send telemetry information for real-time monitoring. Ports, mining companies, manufacturers, and others are using Cisco URWB and our industrial networking to monitor and control robots and autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs)\xe2\x80\x94improving efficiency, overcoming labor shortages, and taking workers out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. Even an eyeblink\xe2\x80\x99s drop in connectivity can\xe2\x80\x99t be tolerated when connecting moving equipment. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we designed Cisco URWB with low latency, high bandwidth and availability, and zero-loss handoffs to support vehicles moving from one coverage area to the next.\n  3 \xe2\x80\x93 Discover how simple it is to manage industrial networks and their connected assets\nConnecting industrial assets like AGVs, factory robots, cranes, and utility substation equipment is a giant step. But to cross the finish line you need the right tools to manage your industrial IoT deployment. At Cisco Live, look out for a demo of Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, designed with operational technology (OT) teams in mind. It provides visibility across the business, integrating the network, connected industrial sensors, and data solutions. And now operations teams can use the dashboard to remotely deploy, configure, and troubleshoot devices and applications connected to Cisco industrial routers. \n4 \xe2\x80\x93 Investigate new types of connected sensors that can improve decision making\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t fix a problem until you know about it. In manufacturing, for instance, product quality or production uptime may be compromised if it\xe2\x80\x99s too hot or cold anywhere on the production line, or if equipment vibration exceeds a threshold. We\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed various environmental sensors throughout the Cisco Live venue to report on the show\xe2\x80\x99s humidity, temperature, and vibration. Visit IoT in the World of Solutions to see them all displayed on Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard.\n6 \xe2\x80\x93 Keep an eagle eye on cyber security threats\nAsk for a demo of Cisco Cyber Vision. It automatically takes an inventory of everything connected to your industrial network and is always on the lookout for suspicious activity. Cyber Vision calculates a risk score for each threat, based on the nature of the threat and the asset, helping you focus attention where it counts the most.\n7 \xe2\x80\x93 Get the inside scoop from our industrial networking and IoT experts\nCome see us at the World of Solutions or drop in on 10- to 30-minute presentations throughout the show.

37,The Bridge to Secure Modern Port Operations,Andy Stewart,"b'By Andy Stewart and Don Leyn\nAt Cisco, deploying advanced cybersecurity capabilities goes in tandem with helping customers such as the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99 and the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest ports and terminals to implement digital business transformation and modernization.  \nZero trust security for digitally enabled ports\nKeeping bulk cargo and shipping containers moving efficiently and safely at a port requires massive amounts of data to be securely transmitted in real time to and from modern applications such as a Terminal Operating System (TOS), autonomous solutions, and other port operations solutions. Data flows and supporting applications have moved closer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe edge\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 closer to the industrial devices, terminal equipment, moving vehicles, and users. In today\xe2\x80\x99s digitally enabled ports and terminals, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s old security perimeter is not sufficient. With the growing number of connected devices, adopting a zero trust security strategy based on a least-privileged approach to network and data access is an absolute necessity to successfully modernize operations.\nUltra-reliable wireless backhaul \xe2\x80\x93 fiberlike wireless anywhere\nMaritime and inland port operators increasingly deploy modern wireless connectivity to move data across the yard and increase outputs. They need technology with ultra-low latency, high throughput, high reliability, and seamless handoffs when on the move in a complex radio frequency environment. At the beginning of the pandemic, a large U.S. East Coast port began a journey of upgrading their existing wireless solutions. After testing several candidates, they chose to implement Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. In 2021, the port\xe2\x80\x99s operations realized a 30% increase in container utilization, and they attribute some of this increase to the improved wireless connectivity capabilities provided by Cisco URWB.\nSolving the three primary cybersecurity challenges\nWhile helping port and terminal operators deploy modern wireless networks to digitize operations, our efforts also help them solve three primary cybersecurity challenges:\nExtreme visibility: Delivering an accurate inventory of what is connected to the network helps them understand the operational configuration and their security posture. This visibility helps prioritize what needs to be fixed to reduce the attack surface, but also provides insights to reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency.\nEnhanced control: With enhanced visibility, operators can understand exactly which devices need to communicate with each other and control how they are communicating \xe2\x80\x93 enabling network segmentation and secure data conduits that permit their terminal operating system (TOS) and other vital applications to exchange data securely.\nFoster collaboration: Gaining visibility into connected devices and communication patterns enables the accurate information transfer needed for operations and IT personnel to collaborate and implement the best security policies. It also enhances operational throughput and efficiencies.\nIt is central to address these issues holistically when taking a zero trust approach to build a customer\xe2\x80\x99s industrial network. As described in NIST SP 800-207, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore undertaking an effort to bring zero trust to an enterprise, there should be a survey of all assets, subjects, data flows, and work flows. [ . . .] This awareness forms the foundational state that must be reached before a zero trust architecture deployment is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus, providing extreme visibility to a port or terminal operator begins with:\nMapping the data flows from and between all the vital applications (e.g., TOS, autonomous systems, crane systems, gate operating systems, camera systems, customer-facing applications, etc.)\nIdentifying and acutely characterizing the associated devices, equipment, and users generating and exchanging this data\nDeriving and specifying operational data exchange characteristics such as required latency, redundancy, prioritization schemas, and bandwidth requirements.\nPolicy and network segmentation\nNext, following zero trust and industrial security best practices\xe2\x80\x94as defined in ISA-95/IEC-62264 and ISA-99/IEC-62443\xe2\x80\x94and using the knowledge from those authorized network flows, we implement policy and network segmentation with a defense-in-depth strategy that builds segmentation and zones with sanctioned conduits to prevent attacks and lateral movement. In short, this entails a bottom-up, trust-nobody approach where every available security capability of the platform is leveraged to provide segmentation, threat-informed security, and governance. This ensures a transparent policy between operations and security personnel \xe2\x80\x93 thus, allowing for secure, safe, and efficient operations in the physical port/terminal.\nYou cannot protect what you don\xe2\x80\x99t see\nCisco security solutions are built directly into network equipment and decode industrial protocols to monitor operations, feed the cybersecurity platform with operational technology context and comprehensive threat intelligence, and, thus, enable security and operational collaboration. With this extreme visibility across all devices and data flows, the cybersecurity platform can automatically detect intrusions and abnormal behaviors, enforce appropriate policy, and alert the security team to act.\nDeep visibility includes the ability to acutely characterize the state of all industrial assets\xe2\x80\x94including device make/model, firmware, latest patches, and other systems factors\xe2\x80\x94to assess industrial asset vulnerability. The Cisco Cyber Vision sensor built into Cisco industrial network equipment makes it easy to build a comprehensive picture of the industrial environment. Security and operations personnel can assess risk and implement a continuous improvement process via deliberate patch management and/or implementing additional isolation to potentially vulnerable devices until it becomes safe and operationally feasible to update the device.\nConclusion\nDelivering effective cybersecurity for critical infrastructure requires a deliberate effort across any organization\xe2\x80\x99s approach to bring together people, processes, and technology. We are excited to enable terminal management and port operations to become more reliable and sustainable through digitization and\xe2\x80\x94integrated with these modernization efforts\xe2\x80\x94make them more secure. An integrated networking and security portfolio helps the maritime transportation sector through this journey \xe2\x80\x93 delivering the best technology, which underpins efficient processes and enables the sector\xe2\x80\x99s personnel with the skills and tools necessary to realize all the possibilities of modern port operations.\nLearn more\nFind out about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s solutions for terminal operations and ports\nDiscover Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive industrial security solution and Cisco Cyber Vision\nLearn more about Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nSubscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Cisco Zero Trust Connected Ports Critical Infrastructure Transportation Wireless Backhaul,"May 19, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1570669172-bpfull.jpg
38,Cut through the noise: find the best fit for your industrial wireless needs,Vivek Bhargava,"b'Wireless technologies have evolved significantly over the years. Wireless solutions used to be limited to sensing less-than-critical applications and connecting user devices. Nowadays, wireless technologies are able to support bandwidth-intensive worker productivity applications, reliable mobility for critical assets, increased data collection from all areas of the plant, and applications that boost operational efficiencies and production uptime.\nWireless is finding uses in every industrial setting. For example, autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) on manufacturing floors, remote-controlled cranes in shipping terminals, trains moving at 200 mph, and autonomous vehicles in mines and oil and gas sites, to name just a few.\nIf you need high data rates, the main candidates for wireless are Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, public and private 5G, and Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. But which technology is best? The best wireless technology depends on your use case and is determined by considerations such as the amount of data, the number of devices, the area of coverage, the criticality of network availability, and whether the data will be used for real-time decisions. (A little lag is acceptable if you\xe2\x80\x99re capturing manufacturing data to study trends\xe2\x80\x94but not if you\xe2\x80\x99re remotely unloading a 50,000-pound container or steering a tele-remote mining vehicle around a bend.)\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t miss out \xe2\x80\x93 Register for this free BrightTalk event.\nIn this blog, we will review the benefits of each of these three wireless technologies. For more details, check out our new white paper: Choose Wireless That Is Best-Fit and Not Force-Fit for Your Industrial Network.\nWi-Fi: The default wireless for most industrial IP devices\nThe latest standards, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E (IEEE 802.11ax), deliver more throughput than earlier standards, and lower latency. Wi-Fi 6 also works with equipment using older Wi-Fi standards. Wi-Fi 6 is an excellent choice for connecting devices via their default Wi-Fi interface, especially in small areas or production lines. It can be difficult to provide good Wi-Fi 6 radio planning for coverage over large areas. Maximum transmit power is regulated, and dense materials like shipping containers or metal walls can interfere with signals.\nPublic 5G: Enhanced mobile broadband\nLike Wi-Fi 6, 5G promises high data speeds and low latency. The enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) 5G service is comparable to wireline networks, with data rates up to 20 gigabits/second (in mmWave frequency bands). Like LTE, public 5G relies on the new C-band spectrum to increase throughput in Sub-6GHz bands. Public 5G is now available in many countries, an advantage for multinational organizations that want to standardize on one wireless technology. Consider it if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to centrally monitor and control remote SCADA sites, HD cameras, or new operational technology (OT) tools like augmented-reality helmets. The drawback is that 5G-enabled devices and C-band services are not widely available.\nPrivate 5G: Private spectrum\nConsider private 5G if you operate in countries where the C-band spectrum is available for private organizations. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good choice for connecting mobile phones, tablets, and IoT gateways that have a built-in 5G interface. Compared to Wi-Fi, it has higher transmit power and is less susceptible to interference since the band is dedicated to private 5G. That\xe2\x80\x99s a winning combination for large areas like aircraft factories, ports, and terminals. You can either manage a private 5G network by yourself or use a managed service. But be aware that people with the networking, cybersecurity, and automation skills to deploy and manage 5G networks are in short supply. Another drawback of private 5G is that few of today\xe2\x80\x99s devices support 5G standalone access (SA). Most support non-standalone access (NSA), which uses the 4G LTE control plane.\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul: fiber-like throughput and seamless handoffs\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul delivers fiber-like performance and can be deployed very quickly. This option shines if you need 700 Mbps or higher data rates, are connecting moving assets, linking locations that are a few miles apart, or need temporary connectivity where it is not practical to pull fiber. Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul uses unlicensed (free) spectrum and is available everywhere. Because the underlying technology is Wi-Fi, you have complete control over your network. Keep in mind that Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul is the infrastructure, not an access mechanism. That means you can use it to connect any industrial device with an Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface. Watch this short video to learn where this technology is being used.\nMatching wireless technologies to your use case\nHere are some sample pairings of industrial IoT use cases and wireless network technologies.\nManufacturing. Manufacturers have very distinct connectivity requirements for warehouses, production lines, AGVs and AMRs, and control loop processes. Reliability is the top criterion\xe2\x80\x94a network glitch that pauses operations can be costly. Which of the three wireless technologies is best depends on your location, bandwidth and latency requirements, cybersecurity needs, the degree to which you want to automate management, and your budget for devices and network infrastructure. To control machinery or mobile equipment over the network, choose Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. With 99.99% availability and seamless handoffs, it avoids wireless hiccups that could stop production or lead to wasted material. If you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting stationery devices and workers\xe2\x80\x99 mobile devices, Wi-Fi 6 or 5G are good options.\nConnected rail. On subways and trains, the onboard network provides passenger Wi-Fi and connects security cameras, digital signage, payment systems, and train-to-ground radios. The trackside needs connectivity for sensors that monitor track status, signaling, level crossings, axle counters, and more. Both 5G and Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul are good candidates for connected rail. Which is best depends on the coverage area, bandwidth requirements, and cost constraints.\nPorts and Terminals. Ports are using industrial wireless networks to load and unload containers faster and improve worker safety and operations. Popular applications include terminal automation, automated container movement using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and autonomous vehicles. To connect workers\xe2\x80\x99 phones and tablets in common areas, Wi-Fi and cellular can be good choices. For coverage across the entire area, with seamless handoff as vehicles move from one coverage zone to another, use Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. Malta Freeport uses Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul to connect its terminal operating system (TOS) to 250 quayside cranes and rubber-tired gantries moving up to 25 miles per hour. The TOS sends the next job order to crane operators wherever they are, eliminating unproductive time spent driving back to the operations center for orders.\nConnected cars. General Motors uses Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul for vehicle-to-trackside connectivity. GM engineers capture data from vehicle sensors during performance testing in real time and adjust the vehicle on the track. This shortens testing cycles and shortens time to market. If you are connecting cars in one location\xe2\x80\x94think Indy cars or vehicles used in open mining\xe2\x80\x94you do not need anything other than Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. If you are connecting vehicles over a regional or countrywide-area\xe2\x80\x94e.g., passenger autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94explore 5G V2X development.\nConclusion\nWith all these great choices, you might find yourself using not one, but two or even all three of these technologies in your operations. The good news is that Cisco provides equipment, security, and automated management tools for all of these, helping you fit wireless smoothly into your end-to-end IP network.

39,Harnessing the power of IoT in manufacturing—4 critical components,Vivek Bhargava,"b'Only 30%! That is how many companies are capturing value at scale from their Industry 4.0 investments, according to a McKinsey study and as described in a new joint report from Cisco and the analyst firm Industrial Transformation Network (IX Network), 4 Critical Components to Harnessing the Power of IoT in Manufacturing.\nManufacturers around the world are investing in industrial IoT solutions hoping to cut costs, reduce downtime, improve quality, and increase efficiency and output. But only 30% succeed in meeting their goals!\nWhat could the other 70% do differently? As the report authors point out, harnessing the power of IoT in manufacturing takes more than technology. They lay out four critical components for IoT success, illustrating their points with real-world examples from manufacturing leaders like Nissan Motors. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick summary of the report.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 Clearly defined business case\nIn the earliest planning stages, get clarity around the business case. Who will benefit? How will work processes change? How will you measure success? As my colleague Paul Didier has said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhether an IoT project gets stuck in \xe2\x80\x98pilot purgatory\xe2\x80\x99 depends on whether you have clear objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d Good business cases for small-loT manufacturers include integrated data models, optimizing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), and mobile apps for workers that give them a pulse on production. Example: at Nissan Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Tochigi Plant, workers monitor production on their smart watches. For mass customization, there\xe2\x80\x99s a solid business case for automating quality inspections.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Small, focused pilot\nAfter you\xe2\x80\x99ve defined your business case, conduct a short pilot with a few machines and sensors, and a small group of users. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing results after 90 days, pull the plug on the pilot and try another. The report authors note that failing fast reassures business leaders that experimentation isn\xe2\x80\x99t overly costly, helping to get them in your corner.\n3 \xe2\x80\x93 Collaboration between IT, OT, and factory workers\nIT and OT teams have complementary skill sets, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t succeed without both. OT teams understand automation control systems and their dependencies. IT teams know how to connect those systems for high performance and security. Both teams also need to understand the other\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and concerns. For example, OT teams consider availability a top priority, only behind safety. That\xe2\x80\x99s because outages can interrupt production and revenue. In contrast, IT teams prioritize data security. Only by collaborating can the two teams define policies that balance availability with security risks. Include solution users (plant managers, QA managers, factory workers) in the earliest planning stages of your IoT project to make sure they see the value of the solution and will actually use it.\n4 \xe2\x80\x93 Robust, automated, and secure network infrastructure\nThe factory network needs to be highly available and have sufficient bandwidth to move data from machines and sensors to the people and systems that act on that data. Keep in mind that switches and access points intended for temperature-controlled offices can fail under harsh factory environments. Look for industrial switches and access points designed to withstand extreme temperatures, humidity, and vibration. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need network management tools that alert you to problems and give clear directions for resolution.\n  For more details on each of the four components of successful industrial IoT programs, I invite you to download a copy of the full report, 4 Critical Components to Harnessing the Power of IoT in Manufacturing. It is a must read before embarking on your own Industry 4.0 journey. Do not be in that 30%!\nFor more insights, check out What\xe2\x80\x99s next for IoT in manufacturing?

40,Mitigating new Industroyer2 and Incontroller malware targeting industrial control systems,IoT Security Research Lab,"b'A new Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) warns that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors have unleashed new malware to gain full system access to industrial control systems (ICS). Industrial organizations and critical infrastructure are at risk. The CSA was issued jointly by the Department of Energy (DOE), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nSecurity researchers from ESET and Mandiant have released details on the new malware, dubbed Industroyer2 and Incontroller. Like Industroyer (aka CrashOverride), Triton, and Stuxnet, this new malware is weaponized to inflict critical damage on industrial control networks, including physical destruction. Here we\xe2\x80\x99ll summarize the attack methods and how to mitigate risk with Cisco Cyber Vision and Cisco Secure Firewall.\nIndustroyer2\nESET and CERT-UA analyzed an attack against a Ukraine-based energy utility launched on April 8, 2022. They uncovered several malware families, including a new variant of Industroyer, which the Sandworm APT group used to target the Ukrainian energy sector in December 2016. That attack led to a power blackout in Kiev. The new variant, Industroyer2, uses the IEC-104 protocol to target high-voltage electrical substations.\nWhere Industroyer used an external file for its configuration, Industroyer2\xe2\x80\x99s configuration is directly embedded in the malware binary. The configuration string contains IP addresses of target devices along with IEC-104 parameters such as application service data units (ASDUs), information object addresses (IOAs), and timeout values. These values are linked to a specific target environment and need to be tailored for each victim.\nTo cover their tracks, the attackers deployed a new version of CaddyWiper on the same machine where they executed Industroyer2. CaddyWiper renders the machine unbootable by erasing the extended information of the drive\xe2\x80\x99s partitions. The analysts believe that CaddyWiper was probably deployed via a Group Policies Object (GPO) on an Active Directory server, and that the GPOs were enumerated using a dedicated PowerShell script. An earlier version of CaddyWiper was executed against a Ukrainian bank on March 14, 2022 and a Ukrainian government entity on April 1, 2022.\nIn addition to Industroyer, the researchers also uncovered Linux and Solaris malware on the energy utility\xe2\x80\x99s network. A worm tries to connect to all hosts on the local network using SSH over specific TCP ports (22, 2468, 24687, 522), iterating through a set of credentials probably gathered before the attack. When the worm reaches a new host, it launches a wiper to destroy the content of disks attached to the system.\nAnalysts have not yet discovered the initial attack vector, nor have they discovered the exploitation chain used to pivot from the IT network to the OT network. Analysis is still underway to determine the full capabilities of Industroyer2, but researchers believe it allows bad actors to maliciously control electrical equipment and inflict damage on the targeted electrical substations.\nThe following network IOCs have been disclosed for Industroyer2:\n195.230.23.19\n91.245.255.243\nIndustroyer2 mitigations\nCisco Cyber Vision supports deep packet inspection (DPI) of the IEC-104 protocol, the main OT vector used by Industroyer2. This will give you visibility into IEC-104 devices connected to the network. Cyber Vision calculates risk scores for these devices, helping you set priorities for strengthening your security posture.\nSetting a Cyber Vision baseline will help detect attacks in progress by identifying suspicious IEC-104 activities\xe2\x80\x94for example, control commands issued by hosts that do not normally issue them. Similarly, Cyber Vision can detect SSH scans performed by the worm, which appear as unusual SSH activities originating from the infected machine.\nIncontroller\nMandiant and Schneider have analyzed Incontroller malware, which targets Omron and Schneider control devices and OPC-UA servers. These are widely deployed in many industries. Incontroller is a collection of tools that attackers use to identify, enumerate, and crash controllers and attack Windows hosts. Mandiant believes that Incontroller is most likely state-sponsored. Its activity is consistent with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s past cyberattacks, and it might be linked to the current invasion of Ukraine and related threats against Europe and North America.\nIncontroller is a set of five tools:\nComponent that can discover, manipulate, and crash Schneider PLCs using a Codesys library\nComponent that can discover and manipulate Omron PLCs and servo drives\nTool that can interface with OPC-UA servers to perform enumeration, read/write node data, and execute brute-force attacks to guess credentials\nCustom remote implant that performs reconnaissance and acts as a command-and-control server\nWindows executable that exploits a vulnerable driver to inject an unsigned driver.\nAll in all, Incontroller uses 83% of the tactics within the MITRE ATT&CK ICS matrix, a knowledge base of adversary tactics. From this we can deduce that its creators intend it for end-to-end attacks, starting with an initial foothold in the IT network and moving to lower levels of the OT network.\nIncontroller targets identified to date are:\nSchneider: Modicon M251, Modicon M258, and Modicon M221 Nano PLCs\nOmron: NX1P2 and NJ501 PLCs as well as R88D-1SN10F-ECT servo drive\nThe Codesys library used by Incontroller can also be used to attack other controllers.\nMitigations for Incontroller\nUse Cisco Cyber Vision to identify equipment that Incontroller targets\xe2\x80\x94Schneider, Omron, and OPC-UA servers. Cyber Vision supports Schneider\xe2\x80\x99s Modbus/UMAS protocol and Omron\xe2\x80\x99s FINS protocol, enabling it to extract detailed device information, such as model name, reference, and firmware version. Cyber Vision also shows whether vulnerable devices communicate with targeted PLCs using the unsecure protocols (Telnet and HTTP) that Incontroller exploits. If so, switching to secure protocols will strengthen your security posture.\nCyber Vision baselines can highlight activities consistent with the malware\xe2\x80\x99s lateral movement and reconnaissance. It also detects suspicious HTTP and Telnet traffic targeting OT devices, as well as Modbus, Omron FINS, and Codesys activities that deviate from your baseline.\nMore visibility into malicious activity associated with Incontroller can be provided by the Snort intrusion detection system (IDS) part of Cyber Vision and Cisco Secure Firewall. The Talos research group has released multiple Snort rules providing coverage for Incontroller. We encourage you to activate rules with the following SIDs: 59587-59596, 59598-59599, and 59601-59605.\nFor additional guidance on how to best protect your industrial environment, read our previous blog post detailing 3 actions to take ASAP.\nLearn more\nExplore Cisco industrial cybersecurity solutions.\nRequest a call from a Cisco IT/OT security expert.

41,Five lessons manufacturing operations can learn from enterprise IT teams,Paul Didier,"b'Digital manufacturing stresses factory networks in ways their designers never dreamed of. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got more devices that need more bandwidth and wider access. You might be pulling ahead of competitors using cloud applications like predictive maintenance or \xe2\x80\x9cdigital twins\xe2\x80\x9d that simulate the effects of changes. Meanwhile, cyber-attacks are increasing. By some accounts, manufacturing was the most attacked industry in 2021.\nTo meet these new demands, legacy production networks need a major facelift. Fortunately, operational technology (OT) teams don\xe2\x80\x99t need to reinvent the wheel. OT has a tradition of looking to IT for inspiration, as when IT charted a course to deploy common operating systems and standard networking some 20 years ago. Today, OT can borrow IT\xe2\x80\x99s tools and techniques to modernize production networks. Here are five lessons from enterprise networks.\n1. Use managed switches\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re still using unmanaged switches, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for an upgrade. Unmanaged switches move information between devices\xe2\x80\x94but that\xe2\x80\x99s it. No monitoring. No ability to prioritize critical traffic. No security protections. Unmanaged switches are typically used for isolated networks, which the controller bridges when needed. But unmanaged switches and isolated networks can\xe2\x80\x99t meet the demands of smart manufacturing. Follow IT\xe2\x80\x99s lead and replace legacy switches with managed switches, which provide more bandwidth, quality of service (QoS), and built-in security protections. Managed switches can also act like sensors, giving you early warning about cyberattacks and looming production problems.\n2. Automate deployment and monitoring\nMany OT teams are still manually configuring and updating their network infrastructure. Manual configuration is time-consuming and prone to error. Typos can cause performance problems or security vulnerabilities. To save time and effort and avoid risk, IT teams automate network infrastructure configuration with software-defined network management tools like Cisco DNA Center. You can, too. Collaborate with IT to enter the switch configuration once into templates or workflows. After that, you can apply the configuration to any or all switches with a click. Cisco DNA Center can also help you keep all network-device firmware current with recommended security updates. Everything is consistent. From the same dashboard you can see network performance problems and step-by-step instructions for remediation.\n3. Gain visibility into production assets and communications flows\nCan you confidently say that you know every asset connected to the production network? Most OT teams can\xe2\x80\x99t. IT teams use automated discovery tools to see all connected devices and their communications patterns. But discovery is trickier in manufacturing environments because of the wide variety of devices and industrial protocols. We built Cisco Cyber Vision specifically for industrial networks. It automatically takes an inventory of every connected device, understands most industrial protocols, and reports details on the connected devices and communications flows. Just as IT does, you can use that information to find opportunities to increase operational efficiency, spot security vulnerabilities that need patching, and establish security policies. What can you discover? Vulnerabilities in your industrial automation and control system. Inappropriate communications, like traffic flowing between industrial systems that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to communicate. Old, unpatched applications that are insecure. A high-definition camera that someone forgot to turn off that\xe2\x80\x99s clogging the network and slowing down production applications. For more ways to improve operational efficiency with Cisco Cyber Vision, read this blog.\n4. Enforce security policies\nLike enterprise networks, production networks typically have a firewall that blocks unwanted traffic from the outside. But some threats will inevitably sneak through and IT teams limit their spread using a technique called segmentation. It\xe2\x80\x99s a key tenet of zero-trust security. The idea is to limit device-to-device communication to what\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely necessary. Machines on different lines typically don\xe2\x80\x99t need to communicate, for example, and keeping them in different segments prevents an infection on one line from spreading to the other. Use Cisco Cyber Vision to understand necessary communications flows and define groups. Then, work with your IT team to use Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to create and deploy security policies. Managed switches (see point 1) enforce these policies.\n5. Use the cloud where it makes sense\nManufacturers are improving operational efficiency with cloud services like predictive maintenance, energy management, and digital twins that simulate how manufacturing processes and assets will perform under different conditions. A Google study found that 83% of manufacturers have a cloud strategy in place. Cloud services depend on a myriad of network connections, applications, and data flows to perform. They are becoming critical to production uptime and product quality, so it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to find out about any performance problems right away. Troubleshooting takes too long when the source of the problem might be your own network, the internet, a failed application, the cloud provider\xe2\x80\x99s network, or the cloud application itself. Enterprise IT teams monitor these complex systems using tools for full-stack observability (FSO). OT can do the same. Use Cisco AppDynamics, Cisco ThousandEyes Internet Insights, and Cisco Intersight Workload Optimizer to see network performance all the way from your industrial devices through the network to the cloud applications.\nLearn more\nOT pros are experts in industrial processes and machines. Fortunately, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to also become a networking expert to move forward with digital manufacturing. Instead, borrow tried-and-true practices from IT teams to keep the network high performing, available, and secure.\nWatch a demo of Cisco Cyber Vision, used for network management, visibility, and segmentation.\nCheck out our Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switching Portfolio Brochure.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco DNA Center Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Network Automation Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Zero Trust Featured Industrial Automation Manufacturing Optimize Manufacturing Operations software defined networks,"April 27, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192415-padidier-1-150x150.jpg
42,General Motors speeds innovation in electric and autonomous vehicles with Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul,Patty Medberry,"b'While it sounds futuristic to jump into your self-driving car and take a nap, tackle some work, or simply admire the view out the window, autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a reality. Autonomous and electric vehicles will lead to a safer, less congested future for all. General Motors is striving to make this vision a reality, and to get there, every minute counts.\nToday, we announced that General Motors is the first automaker to deploy Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul for vehicle performance testing, which can significantly reduce testing time. Performance testing and vehicle development requires large amounts of data to move between systems quickly.\nNow, with Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul for vehicle-to-trackside connectivity, GM engineers can capture development data from vehicle sensors in real time\xe2\x80\x94and adjust the vehicle on the track. This approach is helping GM shorten testing cycles and ultimately leading to improved time to market for technical innovations.\nThe need for speed and agility is driving innovation everywhere\nGM\xe2\x80\x99s innovative process is one more way that reliable, fiber-like wireless is transforming our world.

43,About time! Migrating to the new IP67 industrial router,Nipun Jain,"b'About 10 years ago, Cisco built its first Rugged IP67 router, the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers. Suffice to say it had a unique skill set, such as the ability to withstand a drop from about 15ft high, being dunked in water, and shoved into an oven! These IP67 routers are completely ruggedized, modular platforms that enable you to add IP to your unconnected devices.\nElectric utilities and other industrial customers were able to build a highly secure, reliable, and scalable communication infrastructure on top of their electric grid and other networks. Needless to say, these products are certified to meet harsh environmental standards. They support a variety of communications interfaces, such as Ethernet, serial, cellular, radio frequency (RF) mesh and run Cisco IOS Software. And these routers provide secure connections back to your operations center with ease.\n  Why would you upgrade?\nUtilities all over the world are now undergoing significant transitions in their grids, from transmission to consumption and rising security threats. Regulatory mandates are influencing initiatives related to smart metering, grid reliability, and integration of solar and wind farms into the distribution grid. Do we want to help our customers with an easily deployable and replaceable router? Absolutely!  The Cisco Catalyst IR8140H Heavy Duty Router is the answer. Modularity is an understatement for this router \xe2\x80\x93 the only thing more modular is probably the international space station! And the battery backup capabilities make this the last router you will ever deploy on a pole. The combination of resiliency and modularity will help you keep up with high bandwidth applications and increased demands on computing resources.\nFig 1: next generation of the IP67 industrial router\n  Will I be able to replace my CGR1000 without additional overhead?\nYes! The router is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the CGR1000. The migration guide walks you through some of the key points you need to know before preparing to migrate your network to the new IR8140H. It also explains how we will NOT leave current customers out to pasture, with extended support options for the CGR1000 which is now end-of-sale.\nSee what else the router has to offer here.\nShare'",Tags: 5G Cisco Catalyst IR8100 Heavy Duty Series Routers Cisco Catalyst IR8140H Heavy Duty Router Cisco Industrial Routers Connected Roadways IP67 Oil and Gas Smart Cities Utilities,"April 13, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/04/Nipun-Jain-150x150.jpg
44,Cisco and Transport for NSW: Transforming the future of transportation,Simon Young,"b'John Judge\nCo-author, Cisco Innovation Lab Leader\nFrom congestion to road safety, to connected cars, to mobility-as-a-service (MaaS), and even post-pandemic changes in travel patterns, there are many challenges and changes happening in the world of transport. With these considerations and more, how does an agency take their existing infrastructure, assets, and services, and create a customer-driven platform that will enable them to evolve and support future services and capabilities?\nCisco has partnered with Transport for New South Wales (NSW) to test how technology can be used to tackle the most pressing and challenging problems facing the transport market. This is more important than ever as the world starts opening up, moving again, and becoming more active across the transport system including cars, buses, ferries, trains, and light rail.\nThrough the Digital Accelerator Program at Transport for NSW and Innovation Central \xe2\x80\x94 a joint venture between Cisco and UNSW \xe2\x80\x94 the team is trialling several new applications to envision what the future of transport could look like. The Digital Accelerator Program enables a real-time view of supply and demand to guide future timetabling decisions, creating a foundation for new services and emerging travel options.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are growing the network with cutting-edge technologies to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Game-changing projects and partnerships will shape NSW cities, centres, and communities for generations to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x93 Rob Sharp, Secretary Transport for NSW\nWhat happens when you bring the transport network to the Edge?\nCisco and Transport for NSW are giving the transport network a \xe2\x80\x9cvoice\xe2\x80\x9d through a series of live trials exploring ways in which technology can drive innovation towards an intelligent digital transport system. These trials include using Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Internet of Things (IoT)  and Edge Computing solutions for Public Transport. The goal is to provide real-time asset visibility to enable data-driven decision making and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) at intersections to identify rising congestion and potentially dangerous events to trigger priority intervention.\nCisco and Transport for NSW Sydney success video\nOne way to tackle this is by taking an \xe2\x80\x9coutside-in\xe2\x80\x9d approach. To begin the digitisation process, everything needs to be connected \xe2\x80\x94 from assets to customers. Once connected, these data points can provide an understanding of asset performance and customer behaviour. This can be as simple as providing insights into the real-time location of a bus and the number of customers waiting at the bus stop queue, which in turn enables a better understanding of occupancy levels. This concept can be extended further to more elaborate data sets such as vehicle telemetry and details on road surface conditions. The ability to react to and adjust changing situations and support a dynamic integrated transport system creates a connected, safer, and more reliable journey for the community.\nThis concept is illustrated in the diagram below, where unlocked data can then be ingested by existing or future applications, or even published to an open data platform for third parties to leverage:\nWhere to next?\nThese trials represent the strength of the partnership between Cisco and Transport for NSW to co-innovate and use technology to solve some of the most pressing and challenging transport problems now, and in the future. The trials have proven the technology and benefits are feasible. The next step is to broaden the scope so that the community can reap the benefits across both metro and regional NSW.\nStay tuned for more!\nLearn about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s partnership with\nTransport for NSW \nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Edge Computing Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Transportation,"April 12, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1487615345-bpfull.jpg
45,Securing digital manufacturing—from a vicious to a virtuous circle,Fabien Maisl,"b'What do factory operations (OT) and IT teams have in common? They both want a reliable and efficient industrial network to increase production outputs, reduce downtime, and protect the enterprise from cyber attacks.\nBut beyond that, each team has its own objectives. OT is dealing with crises like supply chain disruptions and the relentless push for sustainable manufacturing, increased productivity, and faster cycles. To counter these challenges they\xe2\x80\x99re investing in plant floor digitization and industrial internet of things (IIoT) applications. IT, on the other hand, is tasked with protecting the enterprise from cyber threats. More cautious than OT, IT enforces security policies that can sometimes restrict free communication flows, defeating the OT team\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.\nNot entirely trusting IT, operations teams can be tempted to work around them to connect new cloud services or even a remote access server of their own. This so-called \xe2\x80\x9cshadow IT\xe2\x80\x9d introduces security vulnerabilities that can put the entire organization at risk, as we saw in the February 2021 cyberattack on a Florida water treatment site. When trust between OT and IT erodes, teams stop collaborating, OT\xe2\x80\x99s modernization efforts are stymied, the attack surface remains uncontrolled, and the whole enterprise suffers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a vicious circle.\nFrom contention to collaboration\nEnterprise IT teams can gain the OT team\xe2\x80\x99s trust by giving them something they really want but don\xe2\x80\x99t have\xe2\x80\x94complete industrial network visibility. Just turn on the Cisco Cyber Vision sensor that\xe2\x80\x99s built into our industrial switches and routers. Cyber Vision automatically generates a detailed inventory of everything connected to the network and their communication patterns. IT gains precise understanding of the security posture. And OT gains insights into what\xe2\x80\x99s causing downtime or operational issues.\nBy providing visibility into the industrial network, Cyber Vision sets the stage for a fruitful IT-OT collaboration. A shared understanding of the network helps both parties define priorities and build trust. Both teams have something to gain by working with the other. The vicious circle becomes a virtuous circle.\nCyber Vision in action\nThis is exactly how Unilin, a leading manufacturer of flooring materials, created a secure digital manufacturing standard for its 21 global factories. In most factories, plant managers were already testing or deploying new industrial IoT technologies to deal with supply chain issues and reduce costs. Without effective cybersecurity, these technologies can threaten manufacturing operations\xe2\x80\x94and also the enterprise network. Unilin\xe2\x80\x99s IT team needed visibility into what was going on.\nAs explained in this new case study, Unilin\xe2\x80\x99s IT team built a relationship with OT by sharing operational insights from Cyber Vision. In just a few minutes, Cyber Vision showed the reason an industrial process was not performing up to par\xe2\x80\x94a configuration change to a machine controller. Without Cyber Vision, troubleshooting would have taken days with a negative impact on production outputs and the bottom line. The plant managers quickly understood the benefits of Cyber Vision and agreed to let IT deploy it in other parts of their network.\nA win-win for IT and OT\nUnilin\xe2\x80\x99s IT team now has complete visibility into the industrial network\xe2\x80\x99s security posture. The IT and OT teams hold weekly meetings to review network issues and discuss new projects. As trust develops, they are also starting to work together on more advanced security measures, such as segmentation. As Pascal Pauwels, Unilin\xe2\x80\x99s Director of infrastructures explains, \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this without the help of the OT team. They know the industrial processes and the machines. But they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it without IT. Building reliable and secure networks is our expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get started\nTo start building a trusted relationship with the factory operations team, just turn on the built-in Cyber Vision sensor in our industrial network devices. Share insights with OT to help them troubleshoot faster, improve network performance, and increase operational efficiency. At the same time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn more about the OT network\xe2\x80\x99s security posture so you can reduce the attack surface.

46,Cisco Industrial Routers and 2G & 3G sunset,Patrick Grossetete,"b'Cellular technology, evolving from 2G, 3G, 4G/LTE and now 5G, is one of the main pillars of industrial IoT networks. It enables connectivity with thousands of remote devices deployed in the field, across industries and use cases.\nLike any technology, cellular technology evolves over time as new releases of 3GPP specifications are developed, implemented by vendors, and adopted by services providers or private networks operators. Today, the main market trend is 4G/LTE services, while new 5G services are now appearing around the world.\nWhat about legacy 2G and 3G services still in use on many industrial deployments around the world?\nThe number of cellular devices reached 8.6 billion in 2021 and associated applications are growing exponentially.  Repurposing spectrum previously utilized on 2G and 3G networks for use with faster and more efficient 4G/LTE and 5G services is part of all mobile network operators planning. The dates for the sunset of 2G and 3G technologies vary by world region and mobile operator. End users must be aware of these sunset dates and migrate to 4G/LTE connectivity prior to these dates to prevent loss of connectivity.\n2G and 3G sunset overview\nWhile the below list of sunset schedules for worldwide 2G and 3G mobile operators is not exhaustive, it supports you to start planning for the impact on your industrial IoT network.\nAT&T \xe2\x80\x93 3G services were sunset on February 22, 2022, while the 2G network was stopped in 2017.\nBell Canada \xe2\x80\x93 3G CDMA network closed on April 30, 2019.\nOrange France \xe2\x80\x93 2G will sunset by end of 2025.\nRogers Canada \xe2\x80\x93 2G and 3G 1900MHz network shut down on June 7th, 2021, and 2G on 850MHz on December 31, 2021.\nSprint \xe2\x80\x93 3G services sunset on March 31, 2022.\nTelefonica Germany \xe2\x80\x93 3G sunset on December 2021.\nTelstra Australia \xe2\x80\x93 3G services will sunset on June 2024.\nT-Mobile \xe2\x80\x93 3G services will sunset on July 1, 2022.\nVerizon \xe2\x80\x93 3G services will sunset on December 31, 2022.\nVodafone UK \xe2\x80\x93 3G will sunset in 2023.\nIndustrial IoT routers \xe2\x80\x93 modularity a KEY requirement\nIndustrial IoT networks leveraging cellular technologies are generally deployed for 5-10 years. The mobile phones industry, with its nearly 15 billion devices [Statista], has a shorter life span of 18-30 months [Statista U.S.]. This represents a challenge for modem vendors. They must renew their chipset to align with new 3GPP releases, while maintaining older generations of modem chipsets and firmware. That is why the deployment of industrial IoT routers such as the latest Cisco IR series with modular cellular interface enables future proofing and smooth evolution of cellular technology without replacing all equipment.\nCisco industrial IoT routers \xe2\x80\x93 preparing for 3G sunset\nAll Cisco industrial IoT routers support 4G/LTE, even those purchased in the last 10 years. It means your industrial IoT network is mostly ready for the 3G sunset. The following best practices will ensure a smooth transition from 3G to 4G.\nRun one of the most recent Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS-XE releases\nUpgrade your modem firmware to the most recent release available on Cisco.com for your modem type. Be aware that Cisco IOS upgrades don\xe2\x80\x99t update your modem\xe2\x80\x99s firmware.\nValidate that your SIM subscription is 4G/LTE enabled and review your data plan as appropriate.\nLock your cellular interface configuration to \xe2\x80\x9call-LTE-only\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid any 3G fallback that may disrupt the communications.\nMonitor the 4G/LTE signal quality in case radio coverage is different between 3G and 4G/LTE services.\nReview Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s router antennas guide in case you would like to plan for new 4G/LTE (e.g. CBRS B48) or 5G (e.g. n77, n78) frequency bands. If required, plan to upgrade the antennas accordingly.\nAutomation and network management tools and security best practices don\xe2\x80\x99t require changes.\nShare'",Tags: 5G Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Wireless Industrial IoT (IIoT),"April 5, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192650-pgrosset-150x150.jpg

48,IE Switching “Experience Matters”,Albert Mitchell,"b'In my first blog post on purpose built switches, I discussed the robust hardware design of our industrial ethernet switches that enables them to withstand harsh environments. In this blog, we will discuss frequently asked questions with the manager of the hardware team responsible for our robust hardware design.\nI have a lot of respect for our hardware team. With collective engineering experience of 100+ years the team has worked multiple generations of Industrial switches as well as industrial routers. The products they design and build come in many shapes and sizes. No two are the same. The requirements and the market are constantly evolving. I have come to appreciate their skill, professionalism, hard work, and dedication. This team is a huge reason why Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Ethernet products are best in the market.\nAfter the Q&A session, my primary takeaway is: experience matters!\nThe picture below represents the work of the Industrial Ethernet switching hardware team.\n  Q: What is your current job at Cisco?\nManager of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT Mechanical Engineering team. Prior to managing the team, I was a mechanical engineer for IE switching and industrial routing products.\nQ: For our audience, what are the fundamental differences between building/designing hardware for industrial deployments versus enterprise or service provider markets?\nThe fundamental difference I think in designing for the industrial deployments is the level of \xe2\x80\x9cRuggedization\xe2\x80\x9d that we must incorporate into the design. This typically involves designing for harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperature, high levels of vibration and shock as well as various levels of water/weather proofing. For our products to meet these conditions, attention to detail in our mechanical and thermal design is imperative. Multiple rounds of design simulation and testing are necessary to achieve a successful design.\nQ: What is it about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s process that enables high quality hardware?\nOur overall design process is structured to ensure a high-quality product. From a mechanical design process, this involves design simulation and informal prototyping early in the development cycle to have high confidence in the initial design. As the product design cycle continues, additional rounds of design review and validation are performed. Specific validation is dictated by a formal product requirements document that states exactly what compliance standards are required. Finally, there are formal reviews where all testing results are documented and certified as passing before the product can officially release to a production state. The overall process of this design flow ensures that high quality design standards are maintained.\nQ: What is Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s approach to meeting the long list of standards and compliance requirements?\nDuring our mechanical design verification testing (MDVT), each new product design will go through a suite of tests focusing on temperature, vibration, and shock parameters. The actual details for each test come from the IEC, SAE, and other industry standard requirements detailed in our product requirements specifications.\nQ: The hardware development team has developed multiple generations of industrial Ethernet switching products. What does all the experience bring to the development of industrialized hardware?\nWithin our IoT mechanical design team we have a collective 100+ years of engineering experience. With such a depth and breadth of technical expertise, we embrace the ever-changing technical challenges that are thrown our way. Within our team we have engineers specialized in key technical areas such as ingress protection design, material selection for corrosive environments, thermal design for natural convection environments and solar loading, as well as many other key areas. Having the expertise in these areas allows us to take on any product design challenge that comes our way and keep Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s product lineup among the best in the Industrial IoT market space.\nQ: without giving away any Cisco proprietary information, can you describe the special considerations that go into the hardware design process for thermal or other types of ruggedization?\nOverall mechanical ruggedization and thermal design encompass the main functions in our group. To ensure a very robust enclosure design we typically cycle prototype level hardware through multiple rounds of industry standard shock, vibration, and drop testing. In addition, we pay close attention to form factor optimization, material selection, and internal layout to keep product size, weight, and costs competitive and within our budgets. For products intended for outdoor deployment we again look closely at paint and material choice as well as internal gasket design. Our outdoor products are typically rated for IP67 which allows them to maintain functionality in water at a depth of up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. Another design requirement for outdoor deployment is salt fog resistance. To be compliant in this area, special consideration needs to be given to material selection and surface treatment as well as paint selection and thickness. One of our final design considerations is thermal/heat management. This design area has become increasingly challenging given the fact that we must design to industrial grade temperature ranges (-40 to 75C) coupled with the fact that we cannot use cooling fans in our products since they need to remain sealed and unvented in most cases. Due to these constraints, we rely on natural convection and conduction to remove heat. Our thermal design process begins with simulation utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. In these simulations we iterate the design until we have something optimized that meets our requirements. After simulation we move on to building prototypes that are thoroughly tested under extreme temperature ranges. Typically, internal enclosure thermal management is required. This will involve individual heat sink and heat spreader design, thermal interface material selection as well as optimized board level layout decisions that allow for a successful design. The design process that we have put in place and outlined above has allowed us to introduce numerous award-winning products into the competitive IoT product landscape and helped Cisco become an industry leader in this space.\nLearn More about IE Switching\nMore on Cisco IE switches cisco.com/go/ie\nMore on Cyber Vision cisco.com/go/cybervision\nRead other blog in the Why Industrial Ethernet Switches series\nMore blogs on Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switching\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Industrial Automation Manufacturing Why Industrial Ethernet Switches,"March 24, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192855-mitchell-150x150.jpg
49,Cisco Radio Aware Routing,Frank Columbus,"b'Cisco Radio Aware Routing addresses several of the challenges faced when merging IP routing and radio communications in mobile networks, especially those exhibiting ad hoc (MANET) behavior. This technology has applications in the defense industry as well as state and local government for search and rescue, law enforcement, and disaster assessment.\nLooking at the Real-World Problem Description \xe2\x80\x93 Mesh Topology\nThe above network is a voice, video, and data network between moving vehicles that consists of both ground and air vehicles. This mobile network is a peer-to-peer mesh that changes as topographical obstructions are encountered and is called \xe2\x80\x9cmobile ad hoc network\xe2\x80\x9d or MANET for short.\nIn the scenario shown above, all 4 trucks have a reliable, consistent connection with the helicopters flying over the same road. The two helicopters always have line of sight and will always have a connection between each other. The trucks may even be able to connect to the other helicopter or a truck on the opposite road when conditions are favorable. Here we see that the path between trucks 1 and 3 are completely blocked. The path between Truck 2 and 4 is about to be blocked.\nOur existing routing protocols such as OSPFv3 and EIGRP need to adjust their path metrics very quickly to maintain a cohesive operational network. The routing protocol also needs a way to get information from the radios, requiring a radio to router protocol that is delivered by Cisco Radio Aware Routing in the form of two open protocols, which we will discuss here.\nCisco Radio Aware Routing provides capabilities that facilitate:\nOptimal route selection based on cross-layer feedback from cooperating radios\nFaster convergence when nodes join and leave the network\nFlow-controlled communications between the radio and its partner router\nEfficient integration of point-to-point, directional radio topologies with multihop routing\nNeighbor Up / Down Status\nHere is a schematic view of a piece of the network:\nWhat Are Underlying Technical Problems that Need to be Solved?\nFluctuations in radio link quality affect throughput and need to be factored into route cost calculation.\nThe self-forming, self-healing nature of a mobile ad hoc network requires immediate recognition of topology changes to help ensure fast convergence.\nRadios need to control the rate at which routers send information to minimize the need for queuing within the radio.\nDirectional radios form point-to-point or point-to-multipoint networks with neighbors, which increases the size of the router\xe2\x80\x99s database and reduces routing efficiency.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Radio Aware Routing?\nEnables network-based applications and information to be delivered reliably and quickly over directional radio links.\nProvides faster convergence and optimal route selection so that delay-sensitive traffic, such as voice and video, is not disrupted.\nReduces impact on radio equipment by minimizing the need for internal queuing/buffering; also provides consistent quality of service for networks with multiple radios. \nHow Radio Aware Routing Works \xe2\x80\x93 Currently Two MANET Choices\nToday, radios have 2 possible RAR protocols which are both supported in select Cisco routers:\nRFC-5578 \xe2\x80\x93 PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) Extensions for Credit Flow and Link Metrics\nRFC-8175 \xe2\x80\x93 Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)\nThe actual choice of protocols is largely dependent on the radio vendor and the intended applications and optimization of their devices.\nRFC 5578 and RFC 8175 provide an effective, cross-layer mechanism for communicating radio network status to IP routers \xe2\x80\x93 RFC 5578 primarily for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) style radios and RFC 8175 is primarily for multiaccess shared media radios that is very similar to WiFi. \n(1) RFC 5578 \xe2\x80\x93 PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) Extensions for Credit Flow and Link Metrics\nThis solution, based on Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 5578, employs PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) sessions to facilitate intranodal communications between a router and a compliant device, such as a mobile radio or satellite modem. A PPPoE session is established between router and radio on behalf of every other router/radio neighbor. Once these PPPoE sessions are established, a PPP session is established end to end. This protocol is particularly suited for TDMA style radios.\nCisco Radio Aware Routing (RAR) using RFC 5578 is specifically targeted at routing over directional radio networks that are built with point-to-point links.\nFrom the abstract of the RFC Document:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis document extends the Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) with an optional credit-based flow control mechanism and an optional Link Quality Metric report. These optional extensions improve the performance of PPPoE over media with variable bandwidth and limited buffering, such as mobile point-to-point radio links.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNeighbor Up/Down Signaling: Enables Cisco routers to provide faster network convergence by reacting to link status signals generated by the radio, rather than waiting for protocol timers to expire. The routing protocols (OSPFv3 or EIGRP) respond immediately to these link status signals by expediting adjacency formation or tear-down.\nLink Quality Metrics Reporting: The PPPoE protocol has been extended to enable a radio to report link quality metric information to a router. Cisco routers have been enhanced so that OSPFv3 or EIGRP routing protocols can factor link quality metrics into route cost calculations.\nPPPoE Credit-Based Flow Control: This PPPoE extension allows a receiver to control the rate at which a sender can transmit data for each PPPoE session, so that the need for queuing in the radio is minimized.\n(2) RFC 8175 \xe2\x80\x93 Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP)\nDLEP is a control protocol between a router and a DLEP enabled radio MODEM. The DLEP message exchange between the router and radio allow the radio to tell the router about the link quality. This is somewhat analogous to the way the bar icon on your cell phone tells you about your WiFi or LTE signal quality.\nFrom the abstract of the RFC Document:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions. In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions.  This document introduces a new protocol called the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP), which provides a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDLEP is better suited for multi-access shared media radios that are very similar to WiFi.\nHow Does DLEP Help?\nWithout DLEP these are 2 equal cost paths to any unadjusted routing protocol.\nWith DLEP routing metrics can be adjusted in real-time to favor the best path.\nWith DLEP the radio network conditions reported can also be used in the router\xe2\x80\x99s Quality of Service (QoS) traffic shaping decisions.\nWith DLEP we have Neighbor Up/Down Status.\nAtmospheric conditions and interference will ultimately favor one band vs. the other. While this example was simplified by only considering a point-to-point technology, DLEP is actually optimized for radio mesh topologies.\nWhy Cisco?\nCisco Radio Aware Routing is the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first router-based implementation of RFC 5578 and RFC 8175. As the global leader in mission-critical networking and IP communications, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver reliable and efficient converged voice, video, and data solutions to organizations around the world.

50,Supply chain efficiency starts with securing port operations,Don Leyn,"b'Anyone who still needed convincing that port modernization is vital got it during the COVID-19 pandemic. One image in particular stays with me. On November 19, 2021, more than 100 ships were waiting to dock at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Some had been idling for two months, disrupting global supply chains and dirtying the air.\nNow is a great time to modernize. In the U.S., for example, port authorities and terminal operators are eligible for funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The U.S. Army Corps will receive $14 billion for ports, waterway, and coastal investments.\nPicturing modern port operations\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some of what\xe2\x80\x99s possible with modern port networks:\nFaster vessel loading and unloading. Load straddle carriers, terminal tractors, reach stackers, cranes, and other handling vehicles with OCR scanners, HD cameras, and navigation systems\xe2\x80\x94all connected to the terminal operations system (TOS) to give drivers real-time instructions.\nSafer working conditions with automated guided vehicles (AGV) or tele-remote operation of container-handling equipment.\nImproved equipment uptime, achieved by transmitting and analyzing real-time vehicle telemetry to predictive maintenance applications.\nIt takes an ultra-reliable wireless network\nThe networks supporting modern port operations need very high reliability and low latency. Wi-Fi is perfect to connect in-vehicle devices. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t designed to connect moving vehicles to real-time applications\xe2\x80\x94much less in large areas with tall container stacks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with a port authority whose Wi-Fi coverage was so spotty that rubber-tired gantry (RTG) operators drove to the non-operational areas after each assignment to pick up instructions for the next. Meanwhile, containers stayed still\xe2\x80\x94and so did ships. Since that operator deployed Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul, vehicles are always connected to the TOS so that drivers can see the next task from wherever they are. Productivity has skyrocketed.\nConsider cybersecurity from the start\nWith better connectivity comes more opportunities\xe2\x80\xa6 and more cyber threats. A reminder came in late February 2022, when a ransomware attack disrupted one of India\xe2\x80\x99s largest container terminals, forcing it to divert vessels to other terminals. Just a few months earlier, suspected foreign government-backed hackers breached a computer network at a major US Port. Fortunately, early detection prevented the intruders to disrupt shipping operations.\nLike traditional enterprise networks, port networks need effective perimeter security based on firewalls and malware detection, but don\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the myth that perimeter security is enough! Ports and terminals are open environments, involving numerous contractors and some outdated technologies. To put the right defenses in place\xe2\x80\x94such as patching vulnerable software and segmenting the network to prevent attacks from spreading to disrupt the entire operation\xe2\x80\x94you need to first identify every connected asset. You also need to monitor industrial communications to detect abnormal behaviors and raise alerts before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\nThis is exactly what Cisco Cyber Vision is designed to do. Built right into the industrial switches installed in cranes and vehicle, it automatically takes a precise inventory to show everything connected to your network. You can see right away, for example, if a contractor has connected an unauthorized wireless access point that could give an attacker a foothold. Cyber Vision also calculates a risk score for each asset so that you know what to fix to reduce the attack surface and keep cargo moving. This visibility is shared with your IT security tools so that you can create and enforce policies restricting which assets can talk to each other. (Not a quayside camera and a database, for instance.)\nCome see our port security solution in action at \xe2\x80\x9cHack the Port 22,\xe2\x80\x9d March 21-25, 2022\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be demonstrating how to use Cyber Vision to secure port operations at Hack the Port 22, a cybersecurity event put on by Maryland Innovation and Security Institute (MISI) and DreamPort, inspired by U.S. Cyber Command.

51,What’s the best industrial router—for you?,Tarannum Parkar,"b'When the ice cream choices are chocolate or vanilla, my decision is easy. (Chocolate.) When the choices expand to dozens of flavors, cone types, and toppings, the decision gets harder.\nThe same goes for choosing the best industrial router. Cisco now offers more than 10 industrial routers to meet widely varying edge requirements\xe2\x80\x94industry certifications, access technologies, stationary versus moving assets, cloud or on-premise management, environmental conditions, and more. Painstakingly comparing data sheets is time-consuming, and not everyone knows exactly what features they need for their use case.\nNew online tool recommends the right industrial router\nNow it\xe2\x80\x99s simpler to select the best 5G router or best Wi-Fi 6 router for your needs, thanks to our new Industrial Router and Gateway Selector Tool. Take a few minutes to answer eight simple questions, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll immediately see a recommendation for the best routers for your use case.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how it works. Visit the website and select your industry. The questions branch off from there. Say you\xe2\x80\x99re in the transportation industry and need to connect assets on the move (e.g., security cameras and payment systems on buses). Your match will be the Cisco Catalyst IR1800 Rugged Series Router.\nOr say you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to modernize utility infrastructure. First you\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked if you need a full-featured IP router with enterprise-grade security, or a basic IP router with simple, secure connectivity. Next, you\xe2\x80\x99ll click to select the type of assets you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting (substation automation, advanced metering infrastructure, etc.). If you select substation automation, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked if the router will be in a cabinet or exposed to the elements. If you answer cabinets, you\xe2\x80\x99ll match up with the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router.

52,Open pit mining—providing a smooth path from Wi-Fi to ultra-reliable wireless backhaul,Bruce Frederick,"b'The mining operators I talk to are either already using autonomous and / or tele-remote vehicles\xe2\x80\x94or want to. It\xe2\x80\x99s smart. Autonomous haulage vehicles and tele-remote vehicles like dozers and drills take operators out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way and make the job more appealing. They also increase overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) by eliminating idle time while operators are bussed in for their shifts. For more on the advantages, check out my first blog in this series.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the holdout? Some operators have been waiting for a more reliable wireless technology before putting expensive vehicles on the line.\nNew Cisco Validated Design for open pit mining\nI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report that the wait is over. Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (formerly Fluidmesh) provides the fiber like performance you need to connect assets on the move to critical applications with confidence. Picture it: 99.99% reliability, up to 500Mbps dedicated bandwidth, negligible latency, security, and zero packet loss during handoffs between access points.\nNow setting up ultra-reliable wireless backhaul is easier than ever. We\xe2\x80\x99ve just published a new Cisco Validated Design for Open Pit Mining. It gives you a fully tested complete design for setting up the network for autonomous vehicles, tele-remote mining, and fleet management. Fleet management involves collecting telemetry information from mining vehicles. A good example of how to use this data would be to know that a $150,000 transmission on a haul truck will fail unless it gets attention in the next 12 hours.\nKeep using your Wi-Fi network\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul is the best way to connect high-value assets. But Wi-Fi still has an important role in mining. Besides connecting laptops and IP phones, Wi-Fi is useful for monitoring the health of tailings ponds. (Tailings are the sediment left over when minerals are extracted.) A ruptured pond can flood nearby neighborhoods, so constant monitoring is critical. Traditionally, slopes engineers drove out to the tailings pond in the morning, took readings, recorded them, and drove back to the operations center hours later to enter the readings in a spreadsheet. The problem: a worrisome reading taken at 8:00 a.m. might not be recorded till 4:00 p.m.\xe2\x80\x94possibly too late to take action to avert catastrophe.\nTo collect time-sensitive readings in real-time, deploy industrial internet of things (IoT) sensors like strain gauges and moisture, movement, and water level monitors. Extend sensor battery life by connecting them to a low-power wireless network like LoRaWAN, and then forward the data over the Wi-Fi network to the operations center. Using Wi-Fi for sensor monitoring preserves ultra-reliable wireless backhaul bandwidth for connecting high-value assets like vehicles.\nHave it your way, with our new access points\nOur newest industrial access points will support both wireless technologies\xe2\x80\x94ultra-reliable wireless backhaul or 802.11\xe2\x80\x94reducing equipment costs and management overhead. If you\xe2\x80\x99re currently using 802.11 for autonomous and tele-remote vehicles and fleet management, you can smoothly move them to ultra-reliable wireless backhaul, continuing to use Wi-Fi for assets like sensors, laptops, and IP phones.\nLearn more\nWireless networks enabling autonomous vehicles for underground mines\nReference architecture for process control networks and refining\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: cisco industrial asset vision Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Mining Open Pit & Underground Mining Wireless & Mobility Wireless Backhaul,"March 8, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/brfreder2.jpg-150x150.png
53,Five myths of IoT/OT cybersecurity: Far from the (hard) truth!,Fabien Maisl,"b'Just like any fast-growing innovative sector, the industrial cybersecurity market largely remains a mystery to many. And where there is mystery, there are myths. In the era of all things being connected and of cybercrime becoming a structured business, the cybersecurity challenge is a daunting one for many companies. This article debunks some of the myths that leave industrial organizations dangerously exposed. While not an exhaustive list, here are five of the big ones:\nI\xe2\x80\x99m protected because my industrial networks are isolated\nFalse. Industrial information systems are often connected to enterprise networks and sometimes even directly to the internet. It is not uncommon to count a dozen or more internet connections per site, although managers are convinced that their industrial control systems (ICS) are completely isolated. Moreover, laptops and USB drives used by maintenance contractors are major vectors for spreading malware, even on isolated systems.\nMy firewalls protect me from cyber threats\nBuilding a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the enterprise and the industrial networks offers a necessary first level of protection. But isolating industrial networks can be an obstacle to industry digitization projects, which require data to flow seamlessly between IT, operational technology (OT), and cloud domains. Organizations need to connect more devices, enable more remote accesses, and deploy new applications. You might even find third-party vendors installing cellular modems to gain remote access to your OT environment so that they can easily update or troubleshoot systems and devices. And what about new applications that require access to the cloud? Do you know what all your industrial devices and are you certain they are protected by your firewall? The truth is, the airgap approach to IoT/OT security is no longer sufficient.\nMy industrial installation is not a potential target\nThis cannot be any more false. Even small companies possess sensitive data and can become the target of a cybercriminal. But the biggest threat might come from ransomware. The criminal business model of ransomware is now well established with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) making it even easier for anyone to launch attacks. As the fight against these cybercriminal organizations is becoming a priority all over the world, the FBI observed many hackers redirecting ransomware efforts away from \xe2\x80\x98big-game\xe2\x80\x99 and toward mid-sized victims to reduce scrutiny. And because these malware are more numerous, the probability of being unintentionally hit increases. A few years ago, WannaCry and NotPetya affected tens of thousands of industrial control systems, causing hundreds of millions of loss revenues, demonstrating that malware generally spread independently of any targeting strategies.\nI am protected because my industrial systems use proprietary protocols\nFalse! Tenacious hackers can very well understand proprietary protocols. These are often intrinsically even more vulnerable because they have not been subject to much public analysis, unlike standard protocols, which have gone through many public reviews leading to continuous security improvements. Furthermore, taking control of an industrial workstation is all a hacker needs to disrupt production. These workstations usually run Microsoft Windows, which is well known by cybercriminals!\nAdding cybersecurity measures will complicate my daily work\nTo the slightest extent, yes. Securing your information systems might sometimes force you to operate in downgraded mode or might require modifying some operating procedures. However, downgraded does not mean stopping operations. Security tools are designed to prevent endangering your operations by identifying threats in advance. Letting malware disrupt your systems? Now that will complicate your daily work!\nTo learn more about how you can secure your industrial infrastructure, visit our IoT security page or contact us to have a conversation around your industrial IoT security challenges.\nWant the latest industry news on IoT security delivered straight to your inbox?

54,IoT network delivers for major European port,Patricia Costa,"b'Until recently, relatively few people understood the vital role that ports and terminals play in the global supply chain. Since 2020, more of the public has experienced supply-chain disruptions\xe2\x80\x94and come to appreciate the importance of smooth-running container shipping.\nA growing number of ports and terminals are embracing digitization to address increasing challenges\xe2\x80\x94from labor shortages to security threats. Indeed, my colleague Wei Zou has highlighted four ways that container shipping is going digital via terminal automation using a terminal operating system (TOS).\nAt La Spezia Container Terminal (LSCT), its TOS is at the heart of efforts to reduce downtime and increase productivity. One of the major port facilities in Europe, LSCT invested in an 802.11 Wi-Fi system for TOS Connectivity more than a decade ago. The solution featured 76 access points and supported nearly 200 pieces of equipment. Despite ongoing upgrades and tuning, the network was increasingly challenged to support the TOS. LSCT was losing minutes a day to equipment downtime. When drivers and crane operators couldn\xe2\x80\x99t connect, they would have to find areas with more reliable Wi-Fi coverage.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have multiple cargo containers stacked on top of one another, you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially creating interferences in the Wi-Fi coverage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stefano Lorenzini, Technical Department of La Spezia Container Terminal. \xe2\x80\x9cThe terminal needed a reliable wireless solution that could accommodate for stacks of metal containers being constantly transported in and out of the port, something that typically obstructs Wi-Fi connectivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBeyond those challenges, LSCT leadership was concerned about the limits of 802.11 Wi-Fi for operational technology (OT) solutions. Issues such as packet loss during roaming, high latency to vehicles, and jitter are severe challenges in automation applications involving video or control. The port needed the right foundation for advanced automation solutions today and in the future.\nWith those goals in mind, LSCT deployed Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (formerly FluidMesh) and Cisco Industrial Wireless 3702 Access Point. Working in parallel with the port\xe2\x80\x99s existing WiFi system, the IoT network creates a low latency roaming wireless backbone. This network is ideal for connecting all \xe2\x80\x9con-the-move\xe2\x80\x9d assets\xe2\x80\x94including ship-to-shore cranes, rubber-tyred gantry cranes, stacking cranes, reach stackers, and terminal tractors.\nUsing Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul, La Spezia Container Terminal has radically improved its wireless network\xe2\x80\x94without a full network replacement.

55,"Cisco Industrial Ethernet, speaking the language",Albert Mitchell,"b'In my first blog in this series on purpose built switches, I detailed the robust hardware design of our Industrial Ethernet switches that enables them to withstand harsh environments. In this blog, I will focus on their software features \xe2\x80\x93 particularly the support of industrial communications protocols \xe2\x80\x93 further cementing the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d in these purpose-built products.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s IE (Industrial Ethernet) switches are designed to leverage as much of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s technology as possible. This includes hardware and software features. Customers expect our software features to behave consistently across product families, including the IE Switching products. Cisco IE switches also run IOS or IOS-XE. There are differences. One difference between Enterprise and Industrial Switching is support for industrial protocols.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a protocol? Protocols define the set of rules by which devices communicate with each other. The internet runs on a protocol referred to an IP. Industrial communications have been using protocols since before IP became as popular as it is today. Every industry seems to have its own set of protocols. Cisco IE switches support a vast majority of these protocols enabling them to be part of any industrial networking solution.\n  Protocol support is one of many reasons that makes Cisco IE Switching popular\nOur Industrial Ethernet (IE) switches are the global market leader in Industrial Ethernet Switching for several reasons:\nOffer a portfolio of din rail and rack mount of industrialized switching products to fit multiple use cases\nHave a high quality, built-to-purpose ruggedized hardware design for reliability in industrial deployments\nLeverage Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s network management and security technologies\nSupport of protocols that enables industrial customers to easily incorporate Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s networking products into their deployments and solutions.\n  Why support industrial protocols?\nIn short, because these protocols are vital for the functionality of any modern industrial operation.\nCisco builds network devices to be deployed in a wide variety of industrial networks and solutions. No two industrial networks are alike. There\xe2\x80\x99s a wide variety of requirements and use cases. And there is at least one protocol used in every industrial solution. The networking infrastructure must support all requirements, use cases, and protocols, no matter what they are.\nWe like to think we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a technology bias. While focusing on our key competency, networking, we will build what customers want to deploy. This applies as well to support of industrial protocols. We are not promoting or supporting one industrial protocol over another. We are not bound to any one technology, solution set, or protocol.\nEnd users, system integrators, and anyone putting together a solution want to use the tools and applications they know and trust and at the same time take advantage of the state-of-the-art networking technology. To enable the tools and applications used in industrial deployments, our IE switches support industrial protocols used to build solutions based on Ethernet networks. Failure to support an industrial protocol often eliminates a networking product as a viable option.\n  What does support for industrial protocol mean?\nJust like the varied industries and protocols, support any one protocol means different things. Protocols differ widely, thus support does too. If you must have a single definition of support, support for an industrial protocol can be equated to \xe2\x80\x98speaking the language\xe2\x80\x99. Our IE switches support the communication of industrial protocols enabling end devices to communicate effectively and efficiently.\nFigure 1: communication flow through the Cisco IE switch\nPROFINET and Ethernet/IP CIP are two protocols commonly used by industrial automation and control systems (IACS). Our IE switches are certified compliant to these two protocols by including the software stacks for them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same software stack as the IACS components. For PROFINET and Ethernet/IP, the Cisco IE switches really do speak the language. Applications using PROFINET or Ethernet/IP can discover and automatically setup Cisco IE switches as a part of the solution, thus avoiding manual procedures.\nFor other protocols, support may mean recognition. GOOSE is a good example of such a protocol. Our IE switches do not need to support the GOOSE software stack. Protocols such as GOOSE use Layer2 Ethernet or Layer3 Internet protocol. Users can build quality of service policies to prioritize the communication of these protocols. The Cisco IE switch can recognize and prioritize industrial protocol running on standard Ethernet or Internet protocol based messages in the network ensuring end to end quality of service. Regardless of the interaction and support for industrial protocols, Cisco IE switches provide fast, reliable, and secured transport.\nWhat about safety protocols?\nEspecially safety protocols. Such as PROFIsafe, and CIP Safety.\nSupport for any protocol implies support for the safety portion of the protocol. Industrial automation (eg: manufacturing) solutions prioritize support for safety protocols. If a protocol has a safety component, then our IE switches support the safety protocol. Most of the time this means recognizing the protocol or the safety messages in the protocol and building a quality-of-service policy to prioritize the communication end to end.\n  What about Cyber Vision?\nCisco Cyber Vision is an application that runs on Cisco IE switches and uses deep packet inspection to analyze all traffic passing through the switch and identify industrial protocols in use.\nCyber Vision does more than \xe2\x80\x98speak the language\xe2\x80\x99. Using its knowledge of industrial protocols, Cyber Vision can identify industrial assets and determine if the payload in these protocols is within operating bounds. It also provides security posture assessments of IACS components.\nThe application running on our IE switches report a summarized version of its findings to the Cyber Vision center, where end users get a real-time visual representation of all the communications on their operational network.\nThe figure below is an example of how Cyber Vision enables users to visualize communication between devices. It recognizes which device is speaking which protocol amongst other things.\nFigure 2: Cisco Cyber Vision visualizes device communication flows\nCyber Vision is a security tool to increase visibility into operational networks.

56,"Practicing Digital Hope, one clean drop of water at a time",Dave Wilson,"b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters how we get there.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis phrase has become a mantra for me and the rest of the IoT team at Cisco. Yes, we are laser focused on helping our customers achieve their business objectives, as well as achieving our own internal goals. But we care about more than just the bottom line. We want to help enterprises succeed, so that everyone benefits \xe2\x80\x93 shareholders, executives, and employees, and also members of their communities.\nA great example of this is how Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT solutions help local governments improve the lives of their citizens. And when it comes to peoples\xe2\x80\x99 wellbeing, few things are more vital than ensuring the safety of the water supply.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m especially excited to congratulate the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority on recently winning the coveted World Smart City Safety & Security Award. Over the last four years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with the city to help ensure the safety and security of the city\xe2\x80\x99s drinking and wastewater treatment facilities.\nWe implemented Cisco Cyber Vision which merges the facilities\xe2\x80\x99 IT and OT (operational technology), providing visibility into every physical and digital device connected to the network. This allows plant operators to quickly detect anomalies that could provide early warning signs of a physical or cyber attack. In addition, our smart water sensors detect everything from leaks to excessive vibration, which could indicate equipment in need of repair or replacement.\nTogether these systems work in concert to help protect Albuquerque\xe2\x80\x99s water supply, from its origins in the Colorado River Basin to the faucets of its 650,000 citizens.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe live in a desert, so water is critical for survival. We have to get it out there and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s clean, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for error. Having a product like Cyber Vision, which helps create a partnership between IT and OT, is critical to achieving that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Kristen Sanders, CISO, Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority\n  The three pillars of IoT\nOur work with Albuquerque Water Utility helps highlight the pillars that are fundamental to our IoT efforts:\nCreating connected communities. Our mission includes everything from connecting and securing physical infrastructure like water, power, and transportation facilities to ensuring that homes, schools, and healthcare facilities have fast, reliable access to the Internet. The goal is to facilitate seamless operations with near-zero latency in any environment.\nPowering intelligent industry. We believe that automating processes and enhancing visibility into physical and cyber assets leads to better, faster business outcomes. The more we can reduce human involvement in low value tasks, the more time people can spend on mission-critical work.\nSafeguarding what matters most. We are keenly focused on defending critical infrastructure and eliminating digital threats before they impact operations. Protecting fundamental human needs like water, power, and mobility are central to this philosophy. Knowing that the heart of your organization is protected is essential to peace of mind.\n  How we get there matters\nAt Cisco we\xe2\x80\x99re grounded in helping our customers achieve their business outcomes. This can mean growing an enterprise, AND taking care of people along the way and doing things to help society as a whole.\nWe all ultimately need the same things. We want the water coming out of our faucets to be fresh and drinkable. Our roadways should be safer, our vehicles more energy efficient. The supply chain has to become more robust, which means that our manufacturing and transportation facilities need to operate at maximum efficiency. We need access to medical care when we\xe2\x80\x99re sick, even if we live a great distance from the nearest hospital. And our children need access to the wealth of information available in the world.\nTechnology can help address these challenges. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things I mean when I talk about practicing Digital Hope. Creating a more connected, more sustainable future. Doing things that are good for people first. And, yes, making the world a better place.\nAlbuquerque Bernalillo Water Utility Authority won the award because it used technology to make its community \xe2\x80\x9cmore livable, sustainable, and economically viable.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good description of what we try to do every day here at Cisco.\n  Dave Wilson is vice president of global IoT sales for Cisco.\n  Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security digital hope Water Utilities,"January 26, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2020/10/Daves-Headshot-150x150.png
57,Cisco’s Catalyst IE9300 powers next-gen substation automation,Marcus Smith,"b'In substations, it\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly difficult to meet today\xe2\x80\x99s needs with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s networks.\nMaintaining the critical balance between electricity generation and consumption is more challenging than ever as renewable energy sources and electrification continue to evolve. Among the many challenges substation network operators are facing in the operational landscape is the increasing complexity of balancing the wide array of new power generation assets (such as solar and wind), with an equally complex consumption model (such as increase in electric vehicle transportation). This real-time balancing act drives operators into connecting more systems requiring higher speeds with lower latency in a confined operational footprint.\nAs the utility grid becomes more automated and subsequently digitized, the reliance on the supporting digital network infrastructure becomes even more critical to the reliability and efficiency of the grid itself. This increase in grid digitization also increases the cyber security threat surface. Regulators and utilities strive for an ever-increasing security posture as traditional substation security approaches come up short due to lack of visibility and centralized security policy enforcement.\nFinally, with this expansion of connected devices in the substation and the constant drive for operational efficiency, utilities are challenged on how to most efficiently manage and operate these new networks while insuring the highest reliability.\nTo solve these challenges, utilities are working toward full-scale grid modernization \xe2\x80\x94 including substation automation. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a matter of if but when and how they will upgrade.\nBased on more than a decade of collaboration with the utility industry, we have developed solutions to digitize and automate substations. On January 20 we announced the Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switch, a high-density fiber port switch, specifically designed for the performance challenges of a substation LAN architecture with a small footprint and ruggedized form factor. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of a new way to approach substation automation and management, and together with the recently released Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Router, the Catalyst IE9300 provides a validated architecture that unifies the substation LAN and WAN \xe2\x80\x93 adding the performance, security, scale and management required for the modernization of the grid.\n  5 essentials for the next-generation substation\nDesigned for grid modernization and substation automation, the Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switch addresses five critical capabilities:\nPerformance at scale. Utilities are being asked to connect more systems at higher capacity with more devices that are streaming more data. This 28-port GE switch has 26 SFP and 2 Combo ports that can be used with either fiber or copper (with appropriate connectors). It meets both the high fiber density requirements of modern substations, and copper where needed. The Catalyst IE9300 supports unrivaled performance at scale \xe2\x80\x93 you can stack up to 8 of these switches, which reduces management burden, allowing you to consolidate substation LAN functionality into a switch, saving space, and reducing power needs. \nAsset visibility and cyber threat detection. Using the built-in capabilities of the IE9300 as a security sensor, Cisco Cyber Vision enables utilities to gain an accurate, real-time view of their operational technology (OT) assets. It also monitors network activity and flags anomalous behaviors that could indicate a cyberattack. \nEnterprise-grade management and automation. Substation operators are increasingly managing their substations as scaled IT assets, utilizing the deep knowledge and capabilities of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s industry-leading network security and management tools. The Catalyst IE9300 runs Cisco IOS-XE and builds upon this \xe2\x80\x93 extending Cisco DNA Center, as well as Cisco TrustSec, MACsec, 802.1x and Flexible NetFlow to the substation LAN.\nSupport for industry protocols. The Catalyst IE9300 supports industry protocols, including PRP & HSR for redundancy PTP timing and automation protocols such as IEC61850 (GOOSE,MMS,SV), IEC104, DNP3 and Modbus, that are essential to substation operations. \nApplication hosting and edge compute. Connectivity needs \xe2\x80\x94 both within a substation and across a utility\xe2\x80\x99s operations \xe2\x80\x94 continue to grow. Substation operators are looking for ways to run applications locally in their substation LAN environments. The Catalyst IE9300 is designed with this need in mind, and with support for Cisco IOx to power Cisco Cyber Vision and the utility\xe2\x80\x99s own applications within the substation LAN. Examples include virtual RTUs, security applications, and more.\nAs utilities advance toward grid modernization, the Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series offers an elegant solution \xe2\x80\x93 consolidating OT and IT networks and automating substations.\nUtilities can improve operations, deliver higher reliability and greater efficiencies at scale  \xe2\x80\x93 all while reducing risk. \nLearn more about the Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switch and how it and the Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Router take Substation Automation to the next level in our webinar on January 27.\n  Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Series Rugged Switch\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Router Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Utilities,"January 25, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/01/IL20220124192807-Marcus-Smith-150x150.jpg
58,Cisco expands Catalyst 9000 Switching Portfolio into the Industrial Space,Vikas Butaney,"b'Listening and learning from our customers are some of the best parts of my day. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing consistently is a sharp focus on business agility, global competitiveness, and workforce flexibility. To adapt, customers are digitizing all aspects of their business, including their industrial spaces, to overcome supply chain disruptions, accelerate automation and transition to hybrid work. But, connecting these industrial spaces and managing networks with the security, scale and performance they need is a huge challenge. For that reason, I am pleased to announce today that Cisco is extending our Catalyst 9000 Series into the industrial space with our new Catalyst Industrial Ethernet 9300 switch.\n  Cisco combines the best of IT and OT to deliver industrial IoT success\nHere at Cisco IoT, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been leading the charge to bring enterprise IT capabilities to the operational space. Operational networks are often less secure, unsegmented, and manually managed with fewer capabilities to proactivity resolve issues. Rapid growth in industrial IoT demands a new type of network with enterprise-grade security, automation, and performance combined with industrial features to meet compliance and use case requirements. And that is what Cisco is bringing to the table across our entire Industrial Networking portfolio with our newest industrial switch.\nFor our customers, that translates into real business value like:\nInnovation and competitiveness. From the utility grid to roadways to high-speed rail and beyond, IoT is in critical areas of business where critical services are delivered, revenue is generated, and innovation has never been more important. The network is critical to deliver the reliable and secure infrastructure that will grow and adapt as the business evolves. Only Cisco provides the performance, visibility, reliability, and security needed in this space at scale. With the Catalyst IE9300, our customers can now bring enterprise-grade networking to industrial environments with purpose-built products ready for mission critical work.\nResiliency and security. With our new switch, customers can now deliver enterprise-grade security to their industrial spaces for deep visibility, segmentation, risk assessment, and zero trust. Take a second to let that really sink in. Today, many industrial organizations have a high-risk profile with environments that are decades old and with little visibility into what is on their network and their communications patterns. With our new capabilities, they can quickly leverage their network to improve their security posture and decrease the risk profile for their business.\nSmarter IT workforce management. Facing skilled employee shortages, our customers are looking for new ways to leverage existing skills and investments. Our Catalyst industrial network portfolio is based on the Cisco IOS-XE Operating System, managed by Cisco DNA Center, and secured by Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). The same Cisco that you know and trust now ready for your teams to extend into the industrial space without having to get another CCIE!\n  The broadest set of networking capabilities in one industrial switch\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve packed the best of IT and OT into our new Catalyst Industrial Ethernet 9300 purpose built for industrial spaces. While the number of features is too many to count, here are three of my favorites:\nAll the power of the industry-leading Catalyst 9000 now for the industrial network. This is the first industrial switch to integrate the groundbreaking programmable Unified Access Data Plane (UADP) ASIC of our Catalyst 9000, bringing the same performance, visibility, and security to the industrial space. Now you can leverage the capabilities of market leading Catalyst 9000 across your entire enterprise using the same tools and skillsets \xe2\x80\x93 no training required!\n8x the density and easier to manage. This is the first industrial switch to support true backplane stacking, creating a reliability and simplicity factor not found in industrial networks today. Stack up to 8 switches and manage them as one \xe2\x80\x94 just like your enterprise network.\nUnprecedented security and visibility. The Catalyst IE9300 embeds Cisco Cyber Vision sensor and works with Cisco Endpoint Analytics to bring visibility into industrial control systems and connected endpoints. Plus, with dynamic network segmentation, OT and IT teams can leverage the visibility gained via Cisco Cyber Vision to enforce security policies to bring zero-trust security to industrial spaces.\nThe result of all these features? Next level visibility, security, and scale that creates the foundation for the industrial network for years to come.\n  The best of everything you know AND new places to take it all\nAll these new capabilities are designed to take the best of IT into operational settings to make businesses more secure and resilient, as well as accelerate digitization and automation. Here are just a few industries where our new Catalyst switch can deliver results.\n  Power Utilities: As the world accelerates towards a renewable energy future, utilities need to handle more sustainable, distributed, and variable energy sources. Utilities are addressing cyber security risks and modernizing substation infrastructure by embracing new networking and security standards. Catalyst IE9300 is compliant with these standards and purpose-built for harsh outdoor environments, making it an ideal foundation for the next-generation substation architecture.\n  Roadways & Tunnels: Highway agencies are also modernizing to improve safety and traffic flow. Toll plazas are being automated using sensors, video cameras, license plate readers, digital signage, and more. Catalyst IE9300 aggregates traffic from multiple access switches, segments networks from multiple agencies for data protection, and transports traffic over long distances without the need for amplification via its fiber interfaces.\n  Oil & Gas: Similarly, oil and gas pipelines stretch over long distances across remote locations. With sensors along the pipeline to detect problems, IoT systems in intermediate pumping stations need robust connectivity. Fiber transport made possible by Catalyst IE9300 helps operators to ensure safety and security of their pipeline distribution systems.\n  Railways: Proper maintenance of tracks, level crossings, signaling, and overhead power lines are vital to efficient functioning and public safety of the critical railway infrastructure. Railroad operators are digitizing these functions and investing in automated systems. Catalyst IE9300 aggregates traffic from trackside sensors and IoT systems and connects them to control centers to enable remote monitoring and maintenance.\n  Read more about our new\nCisco Catalyst Industrial Ethernet 9300 Switch\nand register for our global event\nAnnouncing New Secure Connection Capabilities for Infrastructure Use Cases\nJanuary 25th at 8:00 a.m. PST\nSubscribe to our IoT newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Industrial IoT (IIoT) Oil and Gas Transportation Utilities,"January 20, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
59,Top 10 IoT use cases—and what they demand from your network,Patricia Costa,"b'When I was growing up in Brazil I loved the \xe2\x80\x9cCan you spot the differences?\xe2\x80\x9d puzzle in Coquetel, a children\xe2\x80\x99s magazine. The challenge was to spot slight differences in ten seemingly identical drawings. I thought about similarities and differences when I read the Top 10 IoT Use Cases report from IoT Analytics, published October 2021. These use cases include remote asset monitoring, process automation, vehicle fleet management, optimizing plant or asset performance, and more.  All 10 use-cases share certain network requirements, like cybersecurity, tolerance for harsh environmental conditions, and a way to scale management as the deployment grows. But other network requirements vary based on the use case.\nHere are some questions to help you identify network requirements for your IoT use cases.\nAre your connected assets stationary or moving? How much data will they transmit?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s relatively simple to monitor data from stationary assets. For example, Bouchaine Vineyards collects data from temperature sensors to know when and where to irrigate. Municipal transportation departments monitor traffic signal controllers to know when the controllers need servicing. If you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting stationary assets, the main considerations are:\nBandwidth: You\xe2\x80\x99ll need more if your devices generate lots of data (e.g., point-tilt-zoom HD cameras) or if you\xe2\x80\x99re backhauling data from many devices.\nType of network: Depending on what\xe2\x80\x99s available, you might connect assets to a wired network, Wi-Fi, 3G, public or private LTE, 5G, wireless backhaul, etc. To avoid the complexity of managing different kinds of routers, look for one that gives you a choice of communications modules.\nReliability: If your use case is mission-critical, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need ultra-reliable connectivity. A dropped connection that halts operations can cause financial loss.\nIt gets more complicated when we think about connected assets that are in motion\xe2\x80\x94 for example, Wi-Fi hotspots on trains, environmental sensors on trucks transporting perishables, or container-handling equipment at ports. Network requirements in these use cases include low latency and seamless hand-offs between wireless networks. If you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting moving equipment \xe2\x80\x93 for example, robots, cranes, autonomous vehicles, etc. in warehouses, ports, and mines \xe2\x80\x93 ultra-high reliability is crucial to prevent accidents.\nIs sensor data used for real-time decisions?\nIf so, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a highly responsive network, with low latency. For example, think about tele-remote operation of vehicles in ports and mines, where an operator in the office remotely controls a vehicle while viewing real-time video feeds from a vehicle-mounted camera. Delays in the video feed can mean the operator misses a turn or obstacle, causing an accident. In contrast, if you\xe2\x80\x99re simply checking that perishables in a truck weren\xe2\x80\x99t exposed to unsafe conditions during the trip, a little latency won\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference.\nCommon denominators: cybersecurity, remote management, rugged enclosures\nNo matter how you\xe2\x80\x99re using industrial IoT, some network features are mandatory. Security protections are one. Cyberattacks can cause downtime, revenue loss, worker safety issues, quality problems, and disruption of critical infrastructure services. We design physical security and cybersecurity into all Cisco industrial networking products. For example, hardware devices are tamperproof. Software is authenticated and protected. All traffic is encrypted with the latest standards. And Cisco Cyber Vision provides visibility into all connected assets and monitors their traffic to flag potential breaches.\nAnother universal requirement is secure remote management of network devices. We have tools that help IT teams efficiently deploy and manage a growing number of connected devices\xe2\x80\x94working from the office or home. These include Cisco DNA Center and Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard.\nFinally, equipment deployed outdoors or in warehouse-like environments needs to withstand harsh environmental conditions like extreme temperatures, wind, water and salt.\nOur industrial IoT portfolio has you covered\nSumming up, like the drawings in the Coquetel magazine puzzle, industrial IoT use cases differ in some ways and overlap in others. No matter how you\xe2\x80\x99re using IoT, we have network devices to meet your needs.\nLearn more\nBlog: Why industrial ethernet switches?

60,Modern manufacturing—does your network have what it takes?,Vivek Bhargava,"b'Manufacturers were already digitizing their processes before March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic gave IT and operational professionals in the manufacturing space reasons to want to move faster. Teams that can\xe2\x80\x99t work on the factory floor (pandemic, weather, closed roads, etc.) need a way to monitor and control processes over the network. Supply chain woes\xe2\x80\x94like wildly fluctuating demand and the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal\xe2\x80\x94highlighted the need for agility. A skilled labor shortage has further accelerated plans for automation.\n  Digitization brings visibility and agility\nThe fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, lays the foundation of modern digital manufacturing. It brings together cyber and physical systems, automation, industrial IoT, and better vertical and horizontal integration.\nThe network has a starring role in digital manufacturing, connecting people and applications in any location to factory-floor assets like sensors, actuators, cameras, and industrial automation and control systems (IACS). Benefits of digitization include improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) uptime, product quality, worker safety, cybersecurity, 24/7 asset monitoring and faster new product introduction and accelerating plant buildouts.\n  Four essentials for manufacturing networks\nAs IT and operational professionals work to innovate traditional manufacturing facilities and operations, we must consider that digital manufacturing requires more networks. Here are guidelines for making sure your manufacturing network is up to the task.\nUse network devices specifically designed for industrial environments like factories\nIn addition to high performance and reliability, industrial routers, switches, and firewalls need to withstand harsh environmental conditions like extreme temperatures, shock, vibration, and humidity. They also need to be able to control access, have support for real-time industrial protocols, and enable the flow of key operational data to move across applications in the cloud. Further, the operational networks they build need to be scalable and highly resilient. We designed our industrial routers and switches to meet these requirements.\nGive IT and OT visibility and control into what they care about\nThe manufacturing network is a joint project of the IT and OT teams. If you\xe2\x80\x99re on the IT team, you want a solution that works with your existing network management and security applications, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require significant training or disruption. You want to automate network maintenance and quickly identify and solve performance issues, especially in this business-critical space. If you\xe2\x80\x99re on the OT team, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably not an IT expert. You want visibility of issues that impact availability, product quality, workforce effectiveness and straightforward recommendations to resolve them. Cisco DNA Center \xe2\x80\x93 proven in the largest IT networks \xe2\x80\x93 meets all these needs. It automates time-consuming manual tasks, continuously monitors network health, and provides reports and controls on an easy-to-use dashboard. Cisco Cyber Vision gives you visibility into assets and processes.\nFor agile manufacturing, look for \xe2\x80\x9cplug-and-play\xe2\x80\x9d deployment\nManufacturers are simultaneously expanding production, hyper-customizing products, improving operations, and launching new products and services. To achieve these goals, you need the agility to scale product capacity, change product mix, and reallocate resources as needed. Quickly shift networking and production resources where you need them using Cisco DNA Center\xe2\x80\x99s plug-and-play onboarding and provisioning.\nPay careful attention to cybersecurity\nCybersecurity starts with knowing everything that is connected to your industrial network, who\xe2\x80\x99s talking to each other and what they are saying. Cisco Cyber Vision automatically takes a complete inventory. OT teams use a graphical interface to create production zones (aka network segments) containing all assets that need to communicate. (The painting controller doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to the assembly-line controller.) Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) deploys polices that block unintended communications between segments to keep malware infections from spreading. Cisco Cyber Vision also takes a baseline of each asset\xe2\x80\x99s usual communications patterns, alerting OT and IT teams to unusual behavior that could be a sign of a security breach.\n  Prepare to do more with less\nThe manufacturing skills shortage has widened the skills gap, with fewer experts left on the plant floor to prevent mistakes and solve crises. Connecting your plant floor helps you do more with less. A resilient network with the four qualities I\xe2\x80\x99ve described\xe2\x80\x94rugged devices, IT and OT collaboration, simpler and agile network management, and cybersecurity\xe2\x80\x94helps you proactively identify potential problems, discover the cause, and resolve them before they affect production or quality.\nRead how Nissan uses a Cisco IoT solution to digitize the production line for the powertrain of its new electric vehicle, the Nissan Ariya.\n  Learn more\nCisco DNA Center for Industrial Automation Solution Overview and Design Guide\nCisco manufacturing solutions\nHow Cisco is enabling the future of manufacturing \xe2\x80\x93 white paper\nWhy Cisco Ethernet switches: putting the purpose in purpose-built \xe2\x80\x93 blog\nIndustrial automation networks \xe2\x80\x93 solution brief\nZero-Trust Security for Industrial Operations \xe2\x80\x93 white paper\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco DNA Center Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Validated Design (CVD) Industrial Networking Industry 4.0 Manufacturing Optimize Manufacturing Operations,"December 16, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/1534946365-bpfull.jpg

62,99Bridges uses industrial IoT to power sustainability,Angela Murphy,"b'A vision for sustainable innovation\nA short while ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Derek Mak, who founded the company, 99Bridges in 2019.  He had a clear and ambitious mission: to use technology to power the transition to a circular economy. Derek\xe2\x80\x99s long-term vision calls for innovation in recycling, reusing, refilling, repurposing, reducing and renewing \xe2\x80\x93 all with an eye toward changing long-ingrained consumer habits that are highly detrimental to the environment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe goal is to create tools that help people change the way we live\xe2\x80\xa6It\xe2\x80\x99s not about doing one thing differently. As consumers, we need to change many habits in order to restore and protect the environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a starting point, 99Bridges is focusing on innovation that encourages uptake of and greater consumer engagement around reusable shopping bags.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlastic bags are convenient, but they\xe2\x80\x99re used for an average of 12 minutes. Reusable shopping bags have been around for years, but too often they\xe2\x80\x99re forgotten in the car,\xe2\x80\x9d Derek notes. \xe2\x80\x9cA growing number of retailers and consumers are recognizing the need for a better approach.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Mosaic solution, now being piloted by the Consortium of Retailers, including Walmart, Target, and CVS Health, uses \xe2\x80\x9csmart bags\xe2\x80\x9d in a different way. When consumers reach the checkout, the retail cashier asks if they would like to buy a bag or borrow one for a refundable fee. If they hold on to the bag and continue to reuse it, they can download a mobile app and get rewards points every time they use it. The Mosaic solution is bag agnostic, meaning it can power any smart bags embedded with a standard QR code and/or RFID chip.\nArchitecting for sustainability\nWhen it was time to choose a technology infrastructure, Derek chose a solution that uses RFID chips in the re-usable bags. Sensors and scanners at store checkouts detect when a bag is borrowed, returned, or re-used. The data from the scanners and sensors is sent to IoT controllers at each checkout.\nTo make this work, 99Bridges needed a router that could provide connectivity to the IoT controllers with a form factor that was sufficiently compact for use in retail stores. The selected router needed to be rugged, able to stand up to the dust and dirt in this environment, and not require delicate handling by retail employees. Just as important was the ability to capture, process, and both send and store data at the network edge. At the same time, Derek needed to ensure that the service would be reliable and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need constant manual checking of the IoT controllers. This meant that he needed a way to check the status of the controllers and maintain them remotely. And he needed visibility of the connectivity to the edge devices and controllers. Also, as he plans to roll out the service further, he needed a solution that would scale easily.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was familiar with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s products and knew that the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers would meet our requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe store a few days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of data on every IR1101, using the on-board compute,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThat way we have a local fallback if the network goes down for any reason, and don\xe2\x80\x99t need additional storage hardware.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSingle dashboard for monitoring and maintaining the network and devices\n99Bridges is using Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard and its new feature Secure Equipment Access for monitoring and maintenance activities. IoT Operations Dashboard is used to provision and monitor the Cisco routers and provides visibility of connectivity right through to the connected IoT controllers. And Derek tells me \xe2\x80\x9cWe use Secure Equipment Access to connect to all IoT controllers at the store. We can remotely check the status of the controllers as well as reboot them if necessary. We use it to manage the in-store infrastructure. I receive an alert right to my Apple Watch in the event the system is down\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we start to collect large sets of data about consumers\xe2\x80\x99 recycling and shopping habits, there will be tremendous value in understanding and fine-tuning engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cFor retailers, we want to create a \xe2\x80\x98single pane of glass\xe2\x80\x99 where they can monitor their equipment, and view statistics about how the smart bags have moved between their own and other retailers\xe2\x80\x99 locations.\xe2\x80\x9d Those kinds of insights can help not only in reinforcing sustainable habits but also in creating personalized promotions.\nLooking to the future, Derek has plans to evolve the 99Bridges innovations further. In the meantime, he continues to focus on advancing the 99Bridges mission \xe2\x80\x93 one bottle, one bag, or one reusable at a time. He calls Mosaic the Reusable-OS for the sustainable generation.\nPurchase Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers and get a\nfree, one-year subscription to Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard.\nFor more information\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard\nCisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers\nSubscribe to our Cisco IoT newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Industrial IoT (IIoT),"December 14, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520194112-angemurp-1-150x150.png
63,Connected Roadways and Intersections: a 4-step journey,Tarannum Parkar,"b'With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal in November 2021, state and local governments are looking at transportation projects that will improve safety, simplify operations, and reduce traffic congestion and emissions. Connected technology should be at the centerpiece of your investments for critical infrastructure. In the first blog in this series, I described five high-value projects. (Cliff Notes version: video surveillance, connected traffic signal controllers, traffic signal priority and emergency vehicle pre-emption, dynamic message signs, and remote weather information systems.) In this blog I\xe2\x80\x99ll summarize the kind of network you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to introduce these programs.\nWhere are you starting?\nThink of connected roadways and intersections as a four-stage journey:\nUnconnected infrastructure. If you\xe2\x80\x99re here, you might have loops and timers, but they only connect to nearby equipment and can\xe2\x80\x99t be monitored from a central operations center. Devices could be 20-30 years old.\nBasic connectivity. At this stage you\xe2\x80\x99ve already started connecting equipment and sensors like traffic cameras, security cameras, traffic counters, or toll readers. Now you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to expand to a larger area, or to remotely manage systems to improve safety or alleviate congestion. Many of our Department of Transportation (DOT) customers are at this point in their journey.\nFlexible and secure connectivity. Advanced use cases that improve safety and efficiency include e-tolling, dynamic signage, LiDAR detection of oncoming vehicles (e.g., to warn construction workers of a speeding car), e-ticketing, and detection of wrong-way drivers.\nFully connected networks. The most advanced DOTs are introducing connected and autonomous vehicles, pedestrian safety projects like adding green light time for slow walkers, predictive analytics for vehicle fleets and traffic optimization. I talk more about those use cases here.\nIs your network up to the task?\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what you need to build a robust network to support intelligent transportation systems (ITS):\nModern industrial network devices. Older networks and devices crumple under the demands of ITS. Technicians can\xe2\x80\x99t see device status over the network, meaning they must drive to the field for routine maintenance. Traditional switches and routers aren\xe2\x80\x99t designed to withstand harsh outdoor environments, including extreme temperatures, rain and snow. And existing DOT networks usually lack the bandwidth for video applications and connected automated vehicles. Our industrial Ethernet switches and 5G routers can connect to your legacy equipment, and are built to withstand extreme environmental conditions, and support high-bandwidth applications.\nCyber and physical security protections. Equipment housed in roadside cabinets needs physical protection from bad actors. It also needs cybersecurity protections against attacks that could bring down the network or alter sensor data or responses. Use our network visibility tools to prevent unauthorized access by segmenting the network. For more detail, here\xe2\x80\x99s a good blog on the physical and cyber security protections in our industrial switches and routers.\nSupport for multiple access technologies. Depending on your use case, ITS like traffic signal controllers, cameras, and traffic counters might need to connect via fiber, LTE, 5G, or Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. Our industrial networking portfolio supports all of these access technologies.\nReplaceable communications modules for industrial routers. Order the router with the module you need today and swap it out if your needs change. That costs a lot less than replacing the entire router.\nReal-time data. Days-old or weeks-old data from cameras and sensors isn\xe2\x80\x99t especially useful for taking steps to relieve traffic congestion. Additionally, paying a third party data provider for stale data can prove costly. You can identify real-time traffic patterns from cameras and sensors using our 5G portfolio and management solutions.\nBuild a modern traffic management center\nWe designed our industrial networking portfolio for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) with all of these requirements in mind. Our routers give you the flexibility to upgrade to a new communications technology (e.g., from 4G to 5G) without replacing the entire device. Our switches and routers are built to withstand extreme temperatures, rain, dust, and vibration. You get advanced physical and cybersecurity protections. Management tools like Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard let your operational technology (OT) teams manage your roadside infrastructure from anywhere\xe2\x80\x94supporting remote work and helping you scale your connected roadways and intersections projects across an entire city, county, or state. With its Secure Equipment Access capability, it also enables you and your equipment partners and vendors to securely and remotely access the connected equipment without the need for truck rolls.\nTake the next step in your journey\nGet an IoT Operations Dashboard subscription free for one year when you purchase Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers.\nWherever you are along your journey,  you can deploy faster and reduce risk with tested Cisco Validated Design implementation guides.\n\nWatch the webinar on-demand: Connected Roads and Intersections Make Cities Safer, Reduce Congestion and Optimize Traffic Management\nLearn more\nCisco IoT Solutions for Connected Roadways and Intersections\nConnected Roadways and Intersections solution brief\nInfographic \xe2\x80\x93 Ready to connect the DoTs?\nIndustrial routers and gateways\nIndustrial switching\nUltra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Roadways Connectivity for Roadways and Intersections industrial routing,"December 14, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Tarannum-Rafik-Parkar-150x150.jpg
64,Cisco named market leader in Omdia Industrial Edge Networking Components 2021 report,Vivek Bhargava,"b'Industrial edge networks are everywhere\xe2\x80\x94in factories, ports and terminals, roadways and intersections, mines, and even vineyards. They connect people, applications, and industrial assets like sensors, actuators, industrial control systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces, robots, etc. These edge networks are the foundation for large-scale digital transformation programs that make operations and assets more efficient, introduce new services and revenue streams, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.\nAn all-inclusive industrial network portfolio\nA complete industrial network solution requires many kinds of hardware and software\xe2\x80\x94including network infrastructure (routers, switches, and gateways), management software, and cybersecurity. Our industrial networking portfolio includes everything you need to build a scalable, high-performing, and secure industrial network. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been perfecting our industrial edge technology for several years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s gratifying to me that the analyst firm Omdia reported that Cisco leads every segment of the industrial networking market.\nMust-haves for industrial network solutions\nIndustrial switches and routers share some requirements with enterprise devices. Performance, reliability, and security are essential. They must be easy to manage with capable management tools. (Edge locations like factories and utility substations typically don\xe2\x80\x99t have highly skilled IT staff.) Industrial switches and routers also have some unique requirements, such as withstanding harsh environmental conditions and availability in form-factors such as DIN-Rail or wall mount rather than just rackmounts to fit in tight spaces. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good blog summarizing what\xe2\x80\x99s different about industrial devices.\nFive trends in industrial networking\nIn Omdia\xe2\x80\x99s new report, Industrial Edge Networking Components: 2021 Analysis, an excerpt of which can be found here, Omdia points to several trends driving the growth of industrial networks.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 IT-OT convergence. Successful industrial networks are a joint project for IT and OT. IT brings the skills and tools for network management and cybersecurity. OT understands the role of each asset in production. How they need to connect to the network, how they need to talk to each other, how to take them safely offline, etc. Therefore, IT and OT must work together for a successful outcome. Cisco enables this partnership with a shared set of management and security tools. For example, read this solution brief to see how industrial networks can benefit from this convergence.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Cloud-edge convergence. Organizations are combining cloud and edge computing\xe2\x80\x94using each technology for different types of decisions. Consider a time-sensitive decision, like re-routing an autonomous mining vehicle when the camera detects an obstacle. Making the decision at the edge\xe2\x80\x94on industrial routers running Cisco Edge Intelligence software\xe2\x80\x94avoids delays while data travels to the cloud and the decision travels back. (Check out this blog on edge Intelligence in oil and gas.) On the other hand, networking devices can also collect relevant data from the network and connected endpoints to send to the cloud for decisions or analysis that requires high compute power or storage.\n  3 \xe2\x80\x93 Cybersecurity. More than 50% of manufacturing companies experienced a breach between 2017 to 2020, according to Omdia, and 40% of breaches affected production. To protect operations, we recommend creating and enforcing a consistent security policy across both IT and OT networks. We make that simpler with our comprehensive industrial cybersecurity solution, Cisco Industrial Security. For more, I recommend this blog on securing industrial networks.\n4 \xe2\x80\x93 Visibility. Having an accurate inventory of all your industrial assets and monitoring them to spot potential issues sooner allows you to act faster\xe2\x80\x94ideally before they affect operations. OT teams can spot abnormal device behavior with Cisco Cyber Vision. It brings visibility to connected assets to build inventory, continuously monitors asset behavior to assess their security postures, and helps operational teams troubleshoot issues to ensure production continuity, resilience, and safety. Cyber Vision is embedded into our industrial networking equipment.\nIT teams have better visibility into the network and can keep tabs on its performance with NetFlow and telemetry data that our devices provide with network management tools like Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, Cisco IoT Field Network Director, Cisco vManage, or Cisco DNA Center. Discovering issues early gives you a chance to solve them before they become problems.\n5 \xe2\x80\x93 New technologies and open standards. Omdia gives a shout out to 5G wireless for low latency, reliable communications in industrial settings. Our industrial routers support open standards and have a replaceable communications module. So, if 5G isn\xe2\x80\x99t available in your area today, you can start with another wireless module (3G, private or public 4G LTE, etc.) and swap out the module later. All these connectivity options can be managed from a single dashboard.\n  Reliability rules\nTo Omdia\xe2\x80\x99s top-5 trends powering the growth of industrial networks I\xe2\x80\x99ll add one more: reliability. Downtime in industrial environments isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an annoyance. It can decimate revenues and interrupt critical infrastructure services. We designed our industrial networking products with resilience in mind. Our switches use high-availability protocols to keep the network running with no downtime if a component fails. Our routers have redundant components. For example, a utility introducing advanced metering infrastructure and demand response can configure its routers with multiple transport modules (e.g., MPLS, broadband, 4G LTE, or 5G and FirstNet) and with dual SIMs to connect to different cellular providers.\nTake the next step\nOmdia expects industrial networks will continue to grow into the foreseeable future.

65,The ultra-reliable network behind autonomous and tele-remote mining,Bruce Frederick,"b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s mines are open for business. Not for coal necessarily, but definitely for the critical minerals seen by the Biden administration as essential for economic and national security, like lithium to power batteries or aluminum for wind turbines. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a hitch. Companies are struggling to hire miners.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94NPR, August 18, 2021\nAs miners retire, mining operators are finding it difficult to replace them. One reason for the personnel shortage can be attributed to the fact that mining places people and heavy mining equipment in the same place, and that is a formula for accidents. The good news is that today\xe2\x80\x99s ultra-reliable wireless networks make it practical to operate autonomous and tele-remote vehicles, improving safety, job appeal, and overall equipment efficiency (OEE). Autonomous vehicles, typically used for haulage, are controlled over the network by an automated dispatch system that tells them where to pick up and deposit loads. Tele-remote vehicles, like dozers, are controlled by an operator viewing real-time video from a seat in a nice, air-conditioned operations center, drastically reducing a chance for injury, loss, or accidents.\nHere are three reasons to move toward autonomous and tele-remote mining\xe2\x80\x94and how Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul makes them practical.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 Improved worker safety\nPicture a surface mining vehicle that\xe2\x80\x99s several stories high and carrying 400 tons of ore. An operator who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a smaller vehicle might not even notice the collision. With tele-remote vehicles, operators can work safely from a temperature-controlled office in an operations center anywhere in the world. A collision or an earth fault inside a high wall might still destroy a vehicle, but the operator won\xe2\x80\x99t be harmed.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Improved recruitment and retention\nPotential employees are worried about their safety, and many don\xe2\x80\x99t want to work in extreme remote locations with little to do outside of work. Many fly-in fly-out camps have nothing but housing and food service. With tele-remote vehicles and an ultra-reliable wireless network, you can recruit drivers to work in operations centers located in or near cities. Another benefit: you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay to fly miners to the pit for their four-week shift.\n3 \xe2\x80\x93 Better overall equipment efficiency (OEE)\nIn traditional mining operations, drivers take a bus to the site, another bus to the pit, and then stand in a ready line to start their shift. That can take several hours\xe2\x80\x94while equipment sits idle. Tele-remote and autonomous vehicles reduce or eliminate idle time, increasing OEE.\nThe crucial ingredient\xe2\x80\x94fiberlike wireless\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s been talk about automated mining for years, but only recently has it become mainstream. Why now? Vehicle sensors are better. Smarter AI algorithms help avoid collisions. And Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul brings the fiberlike performance needed to connect assets on the move to critical applications. It leaves traditional wireless networks in the dust with 99.999% reliability, up to 500Mbps dedicated bandwidth, negligible latency, security, and no packet loss during handoffs between access points.\nIn autonomous mining, that reliability is crucial for supporting production goals. A vehicle that loses its connection to the network needs to be shut down for safety reasons. Operations can\xe2\x80\x99t resume until connectivity is restored and safety requirements are met. Some organizations also require a drive-by to see which way the stopped vehicle is pointing. Production might be halted for an hour\xe2\x80\x94at a cost to OEE and production revenue. Our Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul avoids those interruptions.\nBlueprint for success\nWe will shortly introduce a Cisco Validated Design to take the guesswork out of deploying Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul in open pit mines. In the meanwhile, check out our existing Cisco Validated Designs for mining:\nIndustrial Automation in Mining Environments\nWireless Networks enabling Autonomous Vehicles for Underground Mines\n  Subscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul industrial wireless Mining Open Pit & Underground Mining Wireless Backhaul,"December 8, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/brfreder2.jpg-150x150.png
66,Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Wins CRN 2021 Tech Innovators Award,Angela Murphy,"b'The CRN 2021 Tech Innovators Award is a fantastic endorsement for Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, a cloud-based dashboard that helps operations teams manage industrial IoT devices and equipment. IoT Operations Dashboard addresses the needs of enterprises as they move forward in their digitization journey.\nThe promises of digitization at the edge through industrial IoT are many. They include gaining operational efficiency, improving customer experiences, and enhancing business resiliency.\nDeploying an industrial IoT solution provides connectivity to edge equipment. This could include roadside cabinets, bus stops, electronic signage, kiosks and ATMs. Yet a real challenge for operations teams is gaining visibility of this connectivity. And maintaining it without the need for time-consuming and costly site visits. This becomes more important as organizations add more and different types of equipment.\nOperations teams are responsible for minimizing downtime and improving efficiency. They need simple and intuitive tools they can use without deep IT expertise. For example, roadside signage may need to be upgraded. Applying a patch to each device individually takes time. Not only that, but the upgrade needs to fit within defined maintenance schedules.\nEasy, scalable deployment and monitoring\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard provides intuitive tools for operations teams. They can deploy and monitor Cisco industrial IoT routers and gateways easily. And at the same time they can view connectivity to end equipment.\nA new device can be set up easily using a customizable form. The configuration is applied to the device as soon as it is installed and switched on. Once the device is configured, it shows up in the dashboard\xe2\x80\x99s map view, together with the equipment connected to it.\nLarge numbers of devices can be deployed quickly and easily. As soon as each one is set up at its location and switched on, it becomes visible in the map. The dashboard shows information about each device, including any alerts, and connection status. \nRemote upgrades and troubleshooting\nIoT Operations Dashboard also includes Secure Equipment Access. This gives secure access to equipment connected to Cisco industrial routers and gateways. Authorized users can be internal, or external users from a supplier. These users can upgrade a device or troubleshoot issues without compromising the organization\xe2\x80\x99s security policies. \nApplication Management at the edge\nIoT Operations Dashboard now offers remote Application Management. This allows users to download and manage applications at the edge. Application Management at the edge helps to localize data processing. Bandwidth usage is reduced, saving costs.\nIoT Operations Dashboard helps organizations to realize the benefits of industrial IoT.

67,Highlights from UBBA’s inaugural “plugfest” for private LTE— Failover to FirstNet in 5 seconds,Jeffrey Tufts,"b'When a private LTE test network at Utility Broadband Association (UBBA) Plugfest 2021 was temporarily disabled, attendees could be forgiven for going to get a snack. The test would measure our router\xe2\x80\x99s failover time from Anterix\xe2\x80\x99s 900 MHz private LTE to AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s FirstNet. For most routers that\xe2\x80\x99s about five minutes. But just five seconds later the Cisco Catalyst IR1101 Rugged Series Router had reconnected to FirstNet. The snackers missed it. Picture it: line-status fault location, isolation, and service restoration (FLISR) in five seconds versus five minutes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge advance for resilient grid operations.\nThis test took place at UBBA\xe2\x80\x99s first ever plugfest, held in St. Louis from October 18-21, 2021. Founded in 2019, UBBA\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to help members plan, design, and deploy secure, reliable, and resilient private broadband networks to support critical infrastructure. Members include major utilities, technology providers, and systems integrators\xe2\x80\x94all working together to share the latest approaches to grid communications, security, and resiliency. Cisco is a founding member of the UBBA, and we\xe2\x80\x99re huge fans of its collaborative approach to building a modern grid to keep people safe and society productive.\nWhat is a plugfest?\nA plugfest is an event where solution providers come together in one place to test interoperability. This year\xe2\x80\x99s UBBA Plugfest 2021 focused on distribution automation, but test results also apply to other LTE use cases such as transmission and distribution substations, advanced meter collectors, and connected fleet vehicles. The event sold out, a sign that utilities are accelerating their grid modernization programs. Around 300 people attended in person to hear speakers on topics such as rural broadband and grid security, visit vendor booths, and watch demonstrations like the FirstNet failover test I described. Hundreds more attended virtually via Webex. We at Cisco were pleased to donate the shared switching and routing infrastructure for Plugfest as well as Cisco Webex services to broadcast the event to the many participants joining virtually.\nPrivate LTE\xe2\x80\x94its star grows\nMore and more of our utility customers are considering private LTE for grid modernization projects like distribution automation. LTE is proven. And Private LTE offers the speed, flexibility, and security needed for a huge volume and variety of endpoints and applications. Narrowband technologies like NB-IoT and Cat-M are fine for non-critical applications\xe2\x80\x94for instance, sensors detecting whether poles are leaning or have been hit by a tree or vehicle. Broadband is better suited for critical utility use cases. One reason is that broadband supports over-the-air router updates to maintain optimal security posture. It\xe2\x80\x99s now possible for medium-to-large utilities to deploy successful private LTE networks. It\xe2\x80\x99s a proven technology and utilities are finding economic, operational, and security advantages to them.\nFast failover, the missing ingredient until now\nThe utilities I\xe2\x80\x99ve met with say that improving grid resilience is a key reason they\xe2\x80\x99re leaning toward private LTE. We designed our industrial routers with resilience in mind. You can configure the IR1101 with single or dual pluggable communications modules (including multicarrier modems), dual SIMs, and support for a variety of UE LTE categories. In tests at Plugfest, a single IR1101 attached successfully to multiple vendors\xe2\x80\x99 evolved packet core (EPC) products using CBRS (3500 MHz band), Anterix (900 MHz), US Cellular (850 MHz), and FirstNet (750 MHz). The IR1101 failed over from Anterix to FirstNet with just a 5-second interruption in SCADA polling, using standard IP-SLA configurations.\nOne router platform, many use cases\nBesides being resilient, our industrial routers come in different form factors to support various utility use cases. Mount them in racks, on poles, or in vehicles. Use the same pluggable modems that were tested during UBBA Plugfest. All models are built to withstand harsh environmental conditions like extreme temperatures, dust, frequency interference, surge, and humidity. Of course, they also have utility certifications such as IEC-61850-3 and IEEE 1613, and comply with NERC-CIP.\nUsing one router platform for all your modern grid use cases means your workforce needs just one skill set. The large pool of Cisco-trained engineers makes those skills easier to come by. Network automation expedites deployment while reducing configuration errors.

68,A blueprint for the modern industrial network from Cisco and Rockwell Automation,Ram Srinivasan,"b'Static manufacturing operations are going obsolete. Plant managers had to quickly pivot to dynamic operations in the wake of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and \xe2\x80\x9croaring demand.\xe2\x80\x9d Lately I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing from more and more manufacturers interested in smart manufacturing technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), robotics, cloud computing, supply chain technologies, and the industrial internet of things (IIoT).\nSmart manufacturing (aka digital transformation, Industry 4.0 or Connected Enterprise) is a journey. To succeed you need the right technology\xe2\x80\x94and also the right processes and workforce skills. Cisco and our long-time partner Rockwell Automation are working to bring you all three. Our partnership combines Rockwell\xe2\x80\x99s global leadership in industrial automation and digital transformation with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s global leadership in industrial networking and security. By joining forces we\xe2\x80\x99re helping manufacturers become more agile, minimize risk, and optimize production yield.\nTechnology\xe2\x80\x94a blueprint for digitizing industrial operations\nOur latest joint effort is a blueprint for building a plantwide ethernet network. It\xe2\x80\x99s challenging. For example, you probably have equipment from multiple vendors using proprietary protocols. Your network will need to scale to connect many more industrial sensors and IoT devices over the next few years. Cybersecurity is crucial for business continuity\xe2\x80\x94a fact driven home by recent cyberattacks on food producers and energy, water, and wastewater utilities.\nTo take the trial and error out of building secure, reliable, and scalable industrial networks, Cisco and Rockwell Automation have jointly developed an industrial network blueprint. Called Converged Plantwide Ethernet (CPwE), it combines solutions from Rockwell Automation (e.g., Allen-Bradley Stratix) and Cisco (e.g., Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches). CPwE meets OT needs, IT needs\xe2\x80\x94and makes sure that all solution components work well together.\nMajor manufacturers around the world are already using CPwE to improve key performance indicators\xe2\x80\x94reducing total cost of ownership (TCO), decreasing downtime, increasing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), improving asset optimization, and simplifying inventory management. CPwE also gives you the foundation for digital transformation at scale. Examples include high-value, after-sale digital services, condition-based monitoring, and predictive maintenance.\nRockwell and Cisco also collaborate on industrial cybersecurity. For example, Rockwell has added Cisco Cyber Vision to its visibility and threat detection portfolio. Cyber Vision gives you full visibility into your industrial automation and control systems (IACS)\xe2\x80\x94taking a complete asset inventory, identifying device vulnerabilities, tracking critical events, and detecting abnormal behaviors and threats. For more, check out these short articles from Cisco and Rockwell.\nPeople\xe2\x80\x94developing skills in short supply\nTo benefit from modern manufacturing technologies, you need people who know how to put them to work. Rockwell Automation and Cisco are helping to address the manufacturing skills shortage. We and other companies are working with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to build the Connected Systems Institute (CSI). State-of-the-art facilities include a simulated factory where your employees can gain hands-on experience with smart manufacturing technologies.

69,Connected roadway infrastructure—now is the time,Tarannum Parkar,"b'Thanks to the new infrastructure bill, the pace of connecting roadside infrastructure is about to exponentially take off. The bill and its ramification positively impacts anyone who drives, bikes, or walks. Contrary to expectations, telework during the COVID-19 pandemic didn\xe2\x80\x99t reduce accidents. Instead, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that traffic fatalities in 2020 were up 7.2% over 2019. Congestion is returning to pre-pandemic levels. We spend an average of 97 hours a year sitting in traffic\xe2\x80\x94time I\xe2\x80\x99d rather spend playing with my kids. Gridlock costs the U.S. an estimated $179 billion (source: Texas A&M Transportation Institute).\nInvestments with big payoffs\nAgainst this backdrop, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing from state and local departments of transportation (DOTs) looking for the best investments to improve safety, increase efficiency, and reduce congestion and carbon footprints. Below are five projects for roadways and intersections that improve safety and reduce congestion. In my next blog, I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk more about the Cisco solutions behind them.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 Video surveillance at high-traffic intersections and highways\nVideo surveillance helps to improve safety in several ways. Seeing when and where congestion occurs, you can alleviate it with actions like adjusting signal timing at particular times of day. When drivers know the roadway is monitored, they\xe2\x80\x99re inclined to drive more safely, reducing traffic violations. And with real-time video analytics, cities can detect when someone walking with a cane or using a wheelchair or stroller needs more time to cross the street, and then automatically adjust the signal timing.\nVideo surveillance no longer requires expensive cabling throughout the city. Instead, mount cameras at the intersection and install a Cisco industrial router in a roadside cabinet. Our routers stream real-time video to your operations center over cellular, Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul, or fiber connections. By using Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul instead of cabling.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Connected traffic signal controllers\nMany people are surprised to learn that most traffic signal controllers aren\xe2\x80\x99t connected to a network. That means DOTs don\xe2\x80\x99t find out about a signal malfunction until someone calls to report it. Without network access, technicians have to drive to a site to make repairs or adjust signal phase and timing.\nControllers can connect to the network via our industrial switches, industrial routers, or ultra-reliable wireless backhaul solutions. Then personnel at the traffic operations center can detect problems right away, remotely adjust signal phase and timing, and monitor for cybersecurity threats. The payoffs are less congestion, better safety, and fewer truck rolls.\n3 \xe2\x80\x93 Traffic signal priority and emergency vehicle preemption\nTraffic signal priority (TSP) gives extra green-light time to transit vehicles like buses and light rail, helping them stay on schedule and alleviating congestion at intersections. Signal preemption is TSP\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, automatically turning the light green when a first-responder vehicle approaches.\nTo introduce TSP or emergency vehicle preemption, deploy our FirstNet-ready industrial router in a roadside cabinet near the intersection. Or, to connect over fiber, use our industrial switches.\n4 \xe2\x80\x93 Dynamic message signs\nSome message signs are funny. Mostly, they\xe2\x80\x99re a practical way to warn drivers about risky conditions like lane closures, accidents, bad weather, and emergency evacuations. More aware drivers are less likely to get into an accident, and real-time traffic alerts can reduce delays.\nOur industrial internet of things (IoT) solutions make it easy to connect message signs and display dynamic messages to warn drivers about traffic or weather conditions. Signs communicate with an industrial switch or router in a nearby cabinet, which connects to your operations center over a fiber or cellular network.\n5 \xe2\x80\x93 Remote weather information system\nMonitoring weather and road conditions to warn drivers of hazardous conditions ahead can help prevent accidents and delays. Remote weather information systems (RWIS) collect weather data from sensors\xe2\x80\x94for example, fog, high winds, and snowstorms. Our industrial routers retrieve weather data from RWIS and transmit it to message signs over cellular networks.\nRegister now\nConnected Roads and Intersections Webinar\nDecember 14 and 15, 2021\nLearn more about connected roadways and intersections\nCheck back for the next blog in this Connectivity for Roadways and Intersections series for more details on Cisco solutions.\nLearn more about the industrial IoT solutions mentioned here:\nCisco IoT Solutions for Connected Roadways and Intersections\nindustrial routers and gateways\nindustrial switching\nUltra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Roadways Connectivity for Roadways and Intersections industrial routing,"November 3, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Tarannum-Rafik-Parkar-150x150.jpg
70,Emerging trends in IoT gateway and edge application management in a cloud native paradigm,Akram Sheriff,"b'The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust the world into an era of massive digital business transformation across industries like manufacturing, utilities, smart cities, oil and gas, and transportation. To meet these new challenges and keep business operations running smoothly, we need cost-effective solutions. Traditionally, IoT solutions were typically used to reduce operational expenses and increase operational equipment efficiency (OEE). With the onset of the pandemic however, the need for managing business operations remotely across these IoT verticals has increased rapidly. This has led to a sudden, unprecedented shift towards an increased adoption of cloud native IoT management applications hosted by public cloud providers in partnership with IoT SaaS vendors. An example for such a use case is remotely managing operations of IOT gateways and edge compute applications deployed on a manufacturing floor. This migration from having personnel onsite managing and accessing devices, IoT gateways, and edge compute applications to remote cloud based management brings a new set of IoT security challenges that are primarily seen in a cloud native application. While cloud native applications are considered reasonably secure in general, there is still room for improvement. Containers, orchestrators, and APIs present in an application\xe2\x80\x99s surrounding infrastructure represent new attack surfaces. In addition to the cloud service itself, each of these layers has an array of user-defined configuration settings intended to help users apply their security policies. This manual configuration is often fraught with opportunities for user error and misconfiguration, opening the IoT applications to potential security attacks.\nIn addition, new technology and architectural trends are emerging within the functionality of IoT management applications. These new trends change the way gateway management, security, and network management is done for IOT networks. They also alter how edge compute applications run on IoT gateways and integrate with public cloud-based platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. In this technical blog we will discuss some of the emerging architectural trends in the IoT industry. They are classified as the six critical pillars of cloud native IoT management application in a hybrid cloud and multi cloud environment:\nCompute scalability\nHigh frequency data processing\nLow latency data processing\nRobust data processing pipeline\nVariety of IoT protocols\nCloud native IoT messaging service\nWe will discuss these six critical pillars further in detail, but first let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the challenges they are solving.\n  Challenges of distributed edge IoT data infrastructure\nDistributed edge computing makes sense for a variety of use cases in IoT applications. Consider the following challenges with a cloud native integration for the distributed IoT edge:\nBandwidth \xe2\x80\x93 traditionally the available WAN network bandwidth is a focus for data centers. However, this focus will shift towards IoT edge computing use cases as many distributed edge IoT deployments emerge.\nLatency tradeoff \xe2\x80\x93 some IoT use cases would experience increased latency if data processing happened in a cloud or fog layer and there should be a tradeoff to do it in a distributed edge paradigm.\nHeterogeneity\xe2\x80\x93 in a cluster of gateways deployed at the edge, heterogeneous compute capability of these individual gateways could affect the overall efficiency by adding dissimilar components to handle tasks for the edge compute scenario.\nTransparency\xe2\x80\x93 conceals the separated components in a distributed edge network to allow the disparate pieces to work in sync.\nConcurrency\xe2\x80\x93 allows several IoT clients to access shared resources at the edge, which creates concurrent access related problems.\nSecurity\xe2\x80\x93 is simpler when all compute resources are consolidated in a centralized data center but not in a distributed edge as in IoT network architectures.\nBackup \xe2\x80\x93 of dispersed IoT data requires new data protection strategies in a distributed edge IoT to cloud data pipeline paradigm.\n5G enabled IoT applications require a highly dynamic response from the end to end IoT system, which creates the need for a distributed event driven edge compute service. To meet these demands, IoT application developers need a flexible and agile development environment like the cloud native approach to quickly create event driven edge compute applications running on IoT gateways. However, introducing such a cloud native approach can come with its own challenges. Take for example fleet management use cases. IoT gateways are deployed on vehicles for continuous monitoring of GPS location, collecting telemetry, and other diagnostic health information. Adding an additional distributed event processing component at the edge for communicating to a cloud native IoT application to manage these gateways could lead to an increased latency, which may eventually create OT operational issues for the end customer. Therefore, it is very important to design the edge application in a resilient and robust manner. Cisco Edge Device Management offers such capability to seamlessly integrate with Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard.\n  Real-world cloud native IoT illustration of transportation use case\nCisco IR829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers, Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers, and Cisco Catalyst IR1835 Rugged Series Router\nFurther technical challenges that can arise in a distributed IoT Edge compute scenario as follows:\nIn connected vehicle/car related use cases the ECU\xe2\x80\x99s software tech stack embedded in the vehicle is different from those of the cloud application software stack to enable quicker integration based on the API\xe2\x80\x99s exposed by the cloud platforms.\nLimited vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s embedded computing resources and lack of scalability to directly integrate with a cloud native management application\nMobility roaming constraints specific to unstable LTE/4G WAN network link connections for exchanging telemetry data at scale in remote deployments.\nLimited power supply when engines are switched off. The Cisco 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers and out other industrial routing gateways with ignition power management capability address this challenge.\nCAN bus data decoding/encoding via protocol translation at the edge and embedded software development challenges to cater to a wide variety of automotive communication protocols\nImplementing IoT cloud-based management application itself should minimize the risks that could otherwise arise from integrating edge and cloud. Enterprises can also take additional steps to ensure that their entire ecosystem is secure-from the cloud to the IoT endpoints running at the edge. We need to consider the following security specific challenges for cloud native IoT application.\nEnd to end observability\nSecured edge computing stack\nEdge cluster monitoring\nSecure IoT cloud convergence\nEnd to End Cloud native IoT architectural Illustration\n  Embedded code is typically static and tailored to a specific platform. It is tested meticulously to ensure safe, secure, reliable, and deterministic operation. However, Cloud native IoT applications typically run on non-deterministic Linux and have many hidden library and Kubernetes clusters or other infrastructure dependencies.\nThey often can\xe2\x80\x99t be certified to IoT standards such as IEC 61508, ISO 26262, or DO-178C. Even if they could be certified, the cost of certification is prohibitive as it is proportional to the number of effective source lines of code (eLOC) used in the system. For reference, the Linux kernel alone consists of more than 25 million lines of code. The growing number of security threats and attacks happening in the entire stack of IoT systems increase the need for end to end visibility in a cloud native application architecture. We have built a cloud native IoT Security application to mitigate these threats.\nThe challenges and emerging architectural trends as discussed above for different IoT use cases in a distributed edge compute environment drive the need for a scalable cloud native IoT management application architecture.\nLearn more about the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers and other IoT routing platforms, and get hands on experience for IoT transportation fleet management use cases.\n  Possible solutions\nIn some IoT use cases, the IoT product architectures across industries would require CEP (complex event processing) or processing high volumes of data in a 3V (volume, velocity, variety) model. This drives the need for the following IoT application capabilities classified as the six pillars of cloud native IoT management application in a hybrid cloud or multi cloud world.\nCompute scalability: There is an inherent need for scale up/down capability of compute processing power for building IoT applications. This is due to the variety of OT traffic spanning across IoT architectures in different industries.\nHigh frequency data processing: IoT traffic is highly bursty in nature. Therefore, processing of high volume of data without any adverse performance issues to the end-to-end system performance is critical.\nLow latency data processing: The majority of IoT use cases require low latency-based processing of OT traffic flows and data.\nRobust data processing pipeline: Since IoT requires a low overhead and no single point of failure in the data processing pipelines from the edge to the cloud, cloud native application architectures are suitable to handle robust data processing pipeline.\nVariety of IoT protocols: The number of IoT protocols (connectivity, message queues, streaming data, analytics, databases) and specifications of IoT standard have traditionally dealt with interface specifications and related data models, such as device-to-cloud interfaces. This requires cloud native IoT application architecture support.\nCloud native IoT messaging service: The IoT industry\xe2\x80\x99s definition of cloud native IoT messaging service is as follows:\nThe standards-based offering doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rely upon the services of a particular cloud vendor.\nTransparent, elastic scalability that can accommodate peaks and valleys in telemetry data traffic from IoT devices.\nTransparent fault tolerance and high availability that fulfills the service level agreements business critical IoT applications require.\nAbility to run on different public cloud platforms.\nOpen API allows for the integration of the data with other cloud and third-party services.\nIt is easier to build IoT applications or an IoT platform using cloud native principles for both a hybrid cloud and multi cloud journey for our customers and partners. Traditionally, ICS, cyber-physical systems and other operational technology systems were dependent on embedded compute platforms. But the convergence of OT and IT in Industry 4.0 has created a need for building cloud native IoT applications and AEP\xe2\x80\x99s (Application Enablement Platforms). This need is at odds with legacy embedded code running in traditional OT systems. Cisco has built a cloud native IoT management application, which can manage both, the life cycle of edge compute applications and the IoT gateways in a scalable manner.\n  Cisco IoT architectural solution\nWe developed Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard to solve these issues along with the technical debt incurred with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s legacy IoT management applications and based on the global macro trends seen in IoT. The Operations Dashboard comprises of the following main modules: Cisco Edge Device Management, Cisco Edge Intelligence, Secure Equipment Access, and Cisco Industrial Asset Vision. Cisco Edge Intelligence securely handles traffic routed in a hybrid cloud environment from different I/O devices PLC\xe2\x80\x99s devices/OT systems to IoT applications hosted in the public cloud environment. Secure Equipment Access provides capability to remotely manage access and interact with both the gateways and connected devices. This can be used to directly troubleshoot or monitor the IoT devices in your deployment. Operations Dashboard is a cloud native application for deployment, management monitoring, troubleshooting, and gaining insights into IoT network edge connectivity, which is agnostic to different connectivity technologies.\nOperations Dashboard provides the following three key services:\nDeployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, and gaining insights into the operation of industrial IoT routers and gateways, and connected equipment.\nCisco Industrial Asset Vision: Monitoring of facilities and assets using Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s industrial sensors.\nCisco Edge Intelligence: Edge to multi cloud data orchestration.\nFrom a security perspective we offer a full stack observability platform with Cisco Cyber Vision, Cisco Telemetry Broker, and Cisco SecureX to complement the end-to-end security stack for a diverse set of IoT use cases. With this new cloud native paradigm, you can define each network edge as a small cloudlet for doing security analytics at the edge locally\n  Key takeaways\nBased on these emerging market trends in the cloud native IoT application management, IoT security, and the IoT gateway management, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for you to take action. Cisco IOT Operations Dashboard is based on cloud native primitives and addresses the above discussed scenarios. It leverages the available cloud native infrastructure and tools for enabling your successful journey to a hybrid and multi cloud architecture, and future-proofs your investment.\nI would like to thank my colleague, Rajiv Asati for his support in writing this blog.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Edge intelligence cisco industrial asset vision Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cybersecurity industrial routing Mining Oil and Gas Utilities,"October 13, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520194818-isheriff-150x150.jpg
71,PTP serviceability – time is money!,Carlos Gonzalez,"b'\xe2\x80\x9cTime is money!\xe2\x80\x9d A quote that can\xe2\x80\x99t be truer and more crucial for modern industrial networks where timing, precision, and synchronization pave the way for fast-paced current and future services. And in the middle of it all, PTP (Precision Timing Protocol) serves as one of the critical timing protocols making it all possible.\nIt may be logical to think that protecting time, services, and revenue is the goal of building a resilient and secure infrastructure. However, I would like to draw your attention to a meaningful, pragmatic complimentary value add, PTP serviceability. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look in this first blog of our Why Industrial Ethernet Switches series.\nWhat is PTP serviceability?\nServiceability has multiple definitions and may include hardware/software connotations as well as support services. I would like you to think of PTP serviceability as implementing PTP in key infrastructure platforms in a way that is:\nStraightforward to configure (first configuration or ongoing modifications)\nFast and intuitive to manage and monitor (daily checks or keeping an eye out for changes)\nPrecise and accurate to troubleshoot (isolate and understand faults, restore working state)\nCisco IE switches support a robust PTP implementation. Our industrial switches have serviceability features ranging from simple configurations, informational outputs, timing statistics, protocol messages/alerts, and detailed protocol debugs.\nWhy should I care about PTP serviceability?\nMany would agree that Precision Timing Protocol (PTP) is a vital modern timing protocol, but it can be very complex. While PTP specifications and tutorials are readily available in all corners of the internet, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t simple to develop \xe2\x80\x93 the success depends on how well it is implemented.\nThe truth is that PTP needs to be implemented to function easy, fast, precise, intuitive, stable, and informational \xe2\x80\x93 only then will it be serviceable. Cisco industrial Ethernet switches shine in this area.\nThis ease of serviceability translates into fast learning and proactive maintenance by technical staff. Reducing complexity, training time, and cost will increase PTP network awareness in multi-vendor environments and preemptive assessments. It also decreases time to resolution when dealing with planned or unplanned events.\nSo, why should you care? Making PTP serviceable increases efficiency in deploying and effectiveness in maintaining it. Higher productivity will reduce your operational costs and will enhance business continuity.\nIf time is money\xe2\x80\xa6 PTP serviceability protects it!\nOk, I am convinced\xe2\x80\xa6 now what?\nGreat! We agree that PTP serviceability in the Cisco IE products will save your company time and money, especially in a multi-vendor environment. Learning PTP serviceability will ensure effective and timely infrastructure maintenance, reduced operational costs, and above all, it will prepare the technical staff to keep network and services continuity a top priority. Cisco IE provides these capabilities for you.\nNext, I encourage you to dive into all the serviceability features in our IE switches.

72,Will autonomous car racing change your business? It just might,Vikas Butaney,"b'Some days I really get excited about my job. A self-driving race car challenge? That\xe2\x80\x99s just cool any way you look at it. For entertainment, for innovation, and for demonstrating the move to automation that\xe2\x80\x99s already underway across industries. But before we get to that, let me give you a peek inside the first autonomous car race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\nDiscover the Indy Autonomous Challenge\nImagine if you were a college student and you could drive a race car at THE Indy Motor Speedway. Now, take the actual driver out and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re powering.\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) is an innovation challenge across 21 global universities vying for $1.5M in prize money and the opportunity to autonomously run a Dallara AV-21 Indy race car at the Indy Motor Speedway. The money and the race are truly exciting. But, at the core, the event is all about the challenge \xe2\x80\x93 leaders and students coming together to collaborate, build and push the innovation boundaries to a new level. Cisco is a proud premiere sponsor and our IoT products are at the core of this competition.\n  What does this mean for your business?\nAutonomous operations are everywhere. Labor shortages, alongside the growing need for efficiency, business resiliency and employee safety, are accelerating autonomous operations across industries like:\nAutonomous trains: Driverless trains can increase throughput by increasing the frequency of trains on a metro line and at the same time, they deliver a track record for safety that human drivers are unable to match.\nWarehouses and distribution centers: Entirely autonomous loading systems are now taking and fulfilling orders from the supply chain. Forklifts and pickers fetch the product, deliver to the pallet, wrap for shipping, and transport to the shipping dock.\nManufacturing: Autonomous operations \xe2\x80\x93 like Automated Mobile Robots (AMRs) \xe2\x80\x93 empower manufacturers to optimize operations, free up scarce labor, and deliver higher levels of safety.\nThe challenge with autonomous operations and connectivity\nRegardless of the application, connectivity is at the heart of any autonomous solution. And the same holds true for the Indy Autonomous Challenge. Connectivity is required to tell the cars to start their engines, synchronize GPS timing, and to identify the checkered flag. It\xe2\x80\x99s also critical for safety monitoring of telemetry data and driving software performance.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re all familiar with standard WiFi and 5G for mobile devices communications. But these do not provide the reliability needed to ensure a safe race.  When zooming around the track, hand-offs between access points must be near-instantaneous and reliable.\nHello to a new class of industrial networks\nWith the Indy Autonomous Challenge, Cisco IoT technologies are connecting sensors, cameras, radars, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and more with machine learning technologies to power autonomous driving. Ultra-reliable connectivity is critical to unlock that vital on-board data and make it available trackside for real time monitoring. Plus, teams must be able to take emergency control of the vehicle and safely stop if needed. Any network delay or outage can jeopardize the car\xe2\x80\x99s position and its safety.\nIn that environment, not any network will do. Autonomous use cases require data instantly, with zero-packet loss. A new class of industrial networks is needed to handle more network bandwidth, offer zero latency data, and support edge compute for video, machine and operational data. Plus \xe2\x80\x93 the network needs to deliver security, scale, and reliability to adapt quickly, ensuring the vehicle is up and running \xe2\x80\x93 no matter what.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly where Cisco shines\nThe organizers of the IAC, with engineering support from Clemson University\xe2\x80\x99s International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR), evaluated different wireless technologies including 5G, DSRC/V2X, and CV2X. They found that these wireless technologies could not meet the architectural, bandwidth, hand-off requirements and session management needs.\nInstead, they turned to Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (formerly Fluidmesh) and Cisco Catalyst Industrial Switches for their proven history of delivering high speed reliable connectivity in motion.\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul is a unique wireless technology with fiber-like performance for mission-critical applications. Cisco Wireless Backhaul features seamless roaming and ultra-low latency to enable the most demanding real-time applications up to 500Mbps today.\nOur Cisco Catalyst Industrial Switches offer up to 40 Gigabit throughput for the bandwidth and network speed to process information in these environments.\n  Racing to autonomous operations\nConnecting autonomous race cars is very similar to connecting autonomous operations. Cisco has successfully automated a variety of industries including, manufacturing, warehousing/distribution, amusement parks, rail, mines, ports and more. That\xe2\x80\x99s why our solutions were perfect. But don\xe2\x80\x99t just take my word for it:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutomation is a top priority over the coming year for our customers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard Simmons, VP of Technology \xe2\x80\x93 IoT at Logicalis. \xe2\x80\x9cAcross industrial environments, like manufacturing and distribution centers, autonomous vehicles are reducing downtime, improving productivity, and ensuring operator safety.

73,Growing quality wine grapes with less water,Nykaj Nair,"b'Mother Nature throws twists into food growing and production. Even slight changes in temperature, light, and humidity can affect taste or lead to spoilage. California\xe2\x80\x99s grape growers, for instance, are having to adapt to a water shortage. Too much watering is not sustainable\xe2\x80\x94and often not good for fruit quality. Too little, and vines don\xe2\x80\x99t produce or wither away. Food distribution is also ultra-sensitive to environmental conditions. An unnoticed change in the temperature or humidity of warehouses and refrigeration units, for instance, can trigger safety or quality problems.\nIndustrial IoT sensors make growers instantly aware of changes\nBouchaine Vineyards shows what\xe2\x80\x99s possible when food producers  or businesses with a focus on agriculture use Cisco industrial sensors to keep close tabs on the environment. With 104 acres in California\xe2\x80\x99s famous Napa Valley, Bouchaine is a leading producer of sustainably farmed Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The sustainability focus is something Bouchaine and Cisco have in common. We recently announced our commitment to become net zero for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040. Winemakers throughout history relied on their eyes and taste buds to make decisions about irrigation, leafing, fruit thinning, and when to harvest. In 2021, Bouchaine\xe2\x80\x99s winemaker and general manager, Chris Kajani, decided to augment her own senses with data from the industrial internet of things (IoT). The idea: monitor data from industrial sensors installed in multiple vineyard \xe2\x80\x9cblocks\xe2\x80\x9d with different soils, grape varieties, and topological features.\n  Insights about the environment help Bouchaine conserve water\nTo keep the focus on growing grapes and making wine, not IT, Chris and her team wanted a simple solution. They found it in Cisco Industrial Asset Vision, an all-in-one solution including different kinds of industrial sensors (temperature, light, humidity, etc.), gateways that collect data from sensors, and a cloud-based dashboard to view data. Everything works together out of the box. \xe2\x80\x9cInstalling the sensors and gateways was as simple as scanning their bar codes,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris told me. The whole solution was up and running within an hour.\nThroughout the 2021 growing season, Bouchaine monitored temperature, light, and humidity of individual vineyard blocks in more detail than ever before\xe2\x80\x94with a glance at the dashboard. Temperature data figured into decisions about when and where to irrigate. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cisco sensors are helping us preserve one of our most precious resources\xe2\x80\x94water,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re using the data to water only when and where it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d The combination of temperature and light data\xe2\x80\x94tannins ripen in light\xe2\x80\x94helps the team decide which blocks to harvest, when, and plan for future seasons. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sensor data gives us peace of mind that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see changes in the vineyard when there\xe2\x80\x99s still time to take action,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris said.\nNow Bouchaine is getting ready to install more sensors to understand the environment in smaller sections of the vineyard, and to put the data to use in new ways.  Bouchaine has also become an industry leader for virtual wine tastings. Bouchaine wine aficionados, who are shipped wines to taste, can join a Cisco Webex session from any location to learn more about the wines with a private host, without the need to travel. Along with a livestream of the vineyard, they can see current temperature, light, and humidity readings from the Cisco sensors and learn about the impact on the grapes.  In this way Bouchaine is truly harnessing the possibilities enabled by new technologies.\nAll-in-one solution is simple to deploy and use\nThe idea of using sensors for sustainable food growing and production isn\xe2\x80\x99t new. The roadblock until now has been the complexity. We kept simplicity top of mind when we designed Industrial Asset Vision. The ruggedized sensors and gateways are designed to withstand temperature swings, rain, and wind. Installing sensors and gateways is as simple as scanning their bar codes, and sensors even come with batteries. The gateways can connect sensors spread over a large area, reducing the number of gateways to buy and maintain. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve put our expertise in networking and security to work to make sure data remains private.\nLearn more\nIn addition to agriculture, Industrial Asset Vision helps support better decisions in food manufacturing, warehousing, and refrigeration. We build complete, end-to-end industrial IoT solutions by combining Industrial Asset Vision with our industrial IoT switches and routers.

74,Container shipping goes digital—4 ways port authorities and terminal operators boost throughput and security,Wei Zou,"b'As I write this, 31 vessels are anchored and waiting for berths at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of increasing congestion around the world, caused by a surge in imports, worker shortages, and shutdowns at Chinese ports due to COVID-19. Congestion plus a 900% increase in cyberattacks on maritime systems add up to an urgent problem for the world\xe2\x80\x99s supply chains.\nThere is good news, however. Innovative port authorities and terminal operators are increasing efficiency, throughput, safety, and security by connecting people, equipment, and applications over Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. Below, we are providing four top ways IIoT (industrial internet of things) is transforming terminal operations.\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 Terminal automation with terminal operating systems\nTo accommodate mega-ships and increase throughput, terminal operators are automating certain manual processes. The engine for automation is a terminal operating system (TOS) that controls container movement around the port or terminal. For example, automating berth planning, yard operations, and gate operations helps improve utilization of assets, labor, and equipment.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how it works: Information flows between the TOS in the server room to moving assets over Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. Those assets can include vessels, trains, trucks, and container-handling equipment (CHE) like quay cranes, rubber-tired gantries (RTGs), auto straddle carriers, rail-mounted gantries (RMG), etc.\nLeading the way, Malta Freeport connects its TOS to 250 quayside cranes and RTGs moving up to 25 miles per hour over our ultra-reliable wireless backhaul. The TOS sends job orders to crane operators via a monitor on the crane. When operators finish the job, they update their status and continue on to the next job. This eliminates idle time between jobs and increases productivity and throughput.\n2 \xe2\x80\x93 Integrated TOS and OCR\nAs containers are unloaded, cameras on ship-to-shore cranes capture images, including standardized markings indicating origin and destination, condition, door direction, etc. The images travel to a local optical character recognition (OCR) server, which interprets the markings and updates the TOS. The TOS can efficiently schedule offload and select a storage area, and is kept up-to-date on newly arrived containers. Throughput increases and safety improves because workers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to go near heavy equipment to read container IDs.\n3 \xe2\x80\x93 Tele-remote and autonomous vehicle control\nWith an ultra-reliable wireless network, operators can remotely control cranes from the safety and comfort of a temperature-controlled office. The benefit of autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) is their ability to operate continuously, despite bad weather. Overall, downtime is diminished, productivity improves, and operator safety is ensured.\n4 \xe2\x80\x93 Cybersecurity\nMaritime cyberattacks are on the rise. Famously, a ransomware attack on Maersk in 2018 set off a weeks-long disruption in terminal operations across four countries. Digital processes like tele-remote control and TOS increase the attack surface.\nWe recommend a four-step process to defend against cyberattacks at ports. First, understand all assets that are connected to the OT network. (You can\xe2\x80\x99t protect what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about.) Next, segment the OT network into zones containing assets that need to talk to each other. For example, cameras used for OCR don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to the tele-remote controller. Segmenting the network keeps malware that infects one zone from spreading to others. Add continuous scanning for malware and unusual activity. Lastly, create a holistic view of all security events by bringing together information from the IT and OT networks.\nWe make cybersecurity simpler. For starters, automatically discover all industrial assets and assign them to groups using Cisco Cyber Vision. Define policies that control communications within and between groups using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). Our industrial ethernet switches enforce the policy.\nIntrigued?

75,Securing critical infrastructure: 3 actions to take ASAP,Ruben Lobo,"b'The Colonial Pipeline attack is the latest reminder that critical infrastructure needs stronger protection. The problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t the lack of available cybersecurity solutions. It\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite. With so many solutions available, deciding which ones will provide the most value can be overwhelming. It\xe2\x80\x99s a similar feeling to how we felt as children in a toy store, while clutching our pocket money.\nFor basic protections, here are three actions that every critical infrastructure provider should take immediately.\nStep 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Keep unauthorized people out\nNumerous attacks on critical infrastructure can be traced back to a poorly managed user account. Maybe an employee or contractor jotted down login credentials for a rarely used account on a post-it. While that\xe2\x80\x99s a violation of security policy, it happens all the time. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t use multi-factor authentication (MFA), anyone who finds the post-it in a coffee shop can log in.\nTo prevent that scenario, start by creating a central directory (Active Directory or LDAP). Add an account for everyone and everything (camera, meter, etc.) that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to connect to the IT or industrial network. Then require MFA for every internet access attempt\xe2\x80\x94a one-time code sent via email or SMS in addition to the login. Adopting MFA is relatively simple with the Cisco Duo cloud service because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require any hardware or software. Duo also checks that devices like laptops or phones comply with your security policy before allowing them to connect.\nStep 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Know who and what is on your network at all times\nDo you know every asset that\xe2\x80\x99s connected to your OT and IT networks? About half of the companies we talk to don\xe2\x80\x99t. That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem because you can\xe2\x80\x99t protect what you\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of. If you do know, how long before you find out that something foreign has connected\xe2\x80\x94say, an unauthorized sniffer or access point? And can you see who has accessed which files and systems?\nTo automatically discover every asset connected to your OT network, use Cisco Cyber Vision. It also monitors industrial communications to detect abnormal behavior and raise alerts. To know what\xe2\x80\x99s on your IT network, use Cisco Stealthwatch or Cisco DNA Center. To see who is moving what files to which systems, use Stealthwatch, and to analyze file trajectories, use FMC. In an earlier job, I managed security for product designs. If we had tools back then like we have now, we could have prevented a theft of intellectual property more effectively and with a less effort.\nStep 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Minimize the blast radius by segmenting the network\nWhen malware does sneak through the defenses, segmenting the network keeps the threat from spreading to other segments. The smaller the segment, the less the damage. The most basic step is to segment the industrial network from the IT network, by having an Industrial DMZ. Better, segment the industrial network into \xe2\x80\x9czones\xe2\x80\x9d containing only assets that need to communicate with each other, using Cisco Secure Firewall ISA3000.  Eventually, you can make each device its own segment using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and our industrial ethernet switches. That\xe2\x80\x99s the gold standard because you can build rules to strictly control which devices can communicate, under what circumstances.\nAct before attackers do\nThe three steps I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined\xe2\x80\x94access controls, visibility, and segmentation\xe2\x80\x94go a long way towards securing critical infrastructure. They\xe2\x80\x99re like the basic food groups. After that you can go back to the toy store to make cybersecurity continually stronger.\nFor more on securing critical infrastructure, check out these resources:\nBlogs\nCisco Cyber Vision\nCisco Duo\nCisco Secure Firewall ISA3000\nCisco Industrial Ethernet Switches\nTo get the latest industry news on IoT Security delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Security Critical Infrastructure Featured Mining Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Network Segmentation Oil and Gas Utilities,"August 24, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Ruben-Lobo-150x150.jpg
76,Securing Industrial IoT—a duet for OT and IT,Patty Medberry,"b'Cybersecurity has become a regular conversation topic at my dinner table, initiated by my kids and husband. The attack on the Colonial Pipeline brought us long lines at the gas stations and threatened to close school. The attack on the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest meat processing company, JBS, had us wondering if we\xe2\x80\x99d have to radically change the way we eat.\nThe experiences of just one family hint at the massive impact of industrial security breaches on individuals and businesses. Cyber attacks on industrial assets like robots, pipelines, utility smart meters, and service fleets can halt processes\xe2\x80\x94or silently change them. Strong cybersecurity helps to keep trains running, drinking water safe, electricity flowing, and products coming off the assembly line.\nUnfortunately, IT cybersecurity practices that work in the enterprise are not always appropriate for industrial environments. For example, the downtime required to install a simple patch can bring down a production line, affecting revenues, stock price, and customer satisfaction.\nTeamwork between OT and IT\nTo be effective, industrial cybersecurity requires tight collaboration between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). In other words, industrial security is a duet, not a solo. The IT team brings knowledge of security and the network. The OT team contributes expertise and insight into operational and process control technology, such as when machines can be taken offline without affecting production.\nBut collaboration between IT and OT isn\xe2\x80\x99t simple. The two teams have different priorities, different jargon. To meet their common goal\xe2\x80\x94protecting the industrial network without disrupting production\xe2\x80\x94IT and OT need a platform that brings them together, which we call IT and OT convergence.\nVisibility: a good starting place\nWe built Cisco Cyber Vision to deliver a leading industrial cybersecurity solution that helps IT and OT work together. Cyber Vision automatically discovers all assets connected to the network. That\xe2\x80\x99s crucial\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t protect the network if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is connected to it. Cyber Vision takes a baseline of each asset\xe2\x80\x99s normal behavior so it can alert both teams when behavior deviates from the norm. It also integrates with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s security architecture.\nUsing Cyber Vision, IT can extend the visibility and control across the enterprise network to the operational network. And OT gets a security solution that allows them respond to anomalies while keeping production humming.\nFor more about collaboration between IT and OT, check out this white paper.\nSumming up\nI never would have imagined that this year\xe2\x80\x99s cyber events would hit so close to home. Thankfully, the right tools and practices for visibility and risk mitigation are available today. Industrial cybersecurity can\xe2\x80\x99t be a solo performance by either IT or OT\xe2\x80\x94it has to be a duet. Cisco Cyber Vision makes a great conductor.\nLearn more about securing the industrial IoT in this video interview with Michael Shannon, Cisco VP of Engineering for the IoT Business Group. 17 min.\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Security Industrial IoT (IIoT) Oil and Gas,"August 19, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg
77,What’s your IoT/OT security profile? Answer 8 questions to improve your practice,Fabien Maisl,"b'Cyber attacks are spreading beyond offices and data centers to industrial networks.

78,Why industrial ethernet switches? Putting the “purpose” in purpose-built,Albert Mitchell,"b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re going hiking, you need hiking boots\xe2\x80\x94not dress shoes. In the same way, if you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting assets in an industrial environment, you need an industrial ethernet switch, not an enterprise switch. In this first blog or our Industrial Ethernet Switching series, we will discuss what\xe2\x80\x99s different about industrial ethernet switches.\nTight spaces: round pegs don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in square holes\nIndustrial Ethernet switches bring high-speed connectivity outside traditional office buildings, factories, ports and terminals, railways, ships, energy farms, or mines. They connect industrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices like robots, cameras, wireless access points, sensors, and actuators. Anything with an ethernet port.\nSome industrial environments have standard 19-inch racks, but many have cube-shaped metal enclosures shown below in Figure 1. To fit, industrial switches need to be cube-shaped. Introduced two decades ago, our industrial switches come in different sizes and support different numbers of connected devices\xe2\x80\x94from 6 to 26 (figure 2).\nFigure 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Industrial Ethernet devices need to fit in cramped spaces\n  Figure 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco IE3300 Rugged Series\n  Harsh environments: no A/C or other pampering\nEnterprise switches operate in dry, temperature-controlled environments. In contrast, their industrial counterparts might be deployed in desert or arctic climates, dusty warehouses, wind farms, or vibrating places like trains. If you\xe2\x80\x99re deploying at or near the sea, you might even need a waterproof switch. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the metal enclosures where switches are mounted typically have limited air flow and low power availability. That rules out fans, so our industrial switches are self-cooling, dissipating heat through the shell.\nHigh reliability requirements: technicians might be hours away\nUnlike office buildings, industrial spaces typically don\xe2\x80\x99t have on-site IT staff. That means industrial switches need a long mean time between failures (MTBF). We build ours with industrial components and no moving parts.\nThe combination of high reliability and passive cooling add up to significant operational savings over the life span of an industrial ethernet switch.\nSupport for different industrial protocols: multi-lingual\nWhen industrial ethernet switches hit the market, industrial end device vendors (for PLCs, sensors, cameras, etc.) started transitioning from proprietary fieldbus communications to ethernet communications. Based open standards protocol, ethernet eliminates vendor lock, reduces costs, and has the gigabit speeds to support all industrial automation protocols. Ethernet is one common communication infrastructure for all their industrial protocols.\nEthernet\xe2\x80\x99s advantages caught on. Today, industrial ethernet end devices outnumber all other kinds combined as most innovations in industrial protocols rely on ethernet for communications. Helping the transition to ethernet, industrial ethernet switches support practically all industrial automation protocols, including Profinet, CIP/Ethernet IP, Powerlink, SERCOS III, CC-Link, MODBUS TCP, and others.\nHow are industrial switches changing it up?\nGlad you asked! Put on your hiking boots and check back for our next blogs, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll describe how industrial ethernet is transforming business, and the technology behind it.\n  Get more information on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Ethernet portfolio, watch a short video on the latest Cisco Industrial Ethernet products, and find more Cisco IoT innovations here.\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Critical Infrastructure Industrial Internet of Things IoT in manufacturing Mining Oil and Gas Utilities Why Industrial Ethernet Switches,"August 3, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192855-mitchell-150x150.jpg
79,What is OPC-UA—and how does it manage security?,IoT Security Research Lab,"b'Introduced in 1994, Open Platform Communications (OPC) is an interoperability standard for industrial control system components like programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces, and supervisory software. Using OPC, components from different vendors can reliably exchange data to control an industrial process.\nClassic OPC was released in an era when security was not a concern for OT systems. Industrial networks were isolated and perceived as secure because they used proprietary protocols. \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity by obscurity\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work in today\xe2\x80\x99s connected industrial environments.\nBut securing Classic OPC is challenging:\nOPC relies on Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) security. It is based on access control lists (ACLs) which can be very complex\xe2\x80\x94especially when OPC clients and servers are in different security An administrator might be tempted to disable DCOM security measures, allowing remote access without authentication.\nThe complexity of DCOM configurations increases the risks of errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.\nDCOM uses dynamically assigned ports to set up a communication channel between an OPC client and an OPC server. As a result, given the range of possible ports, firewall configurations tend to be very permissive which constitutes another security risk. You can purchase firewalls that dynamically open and close ports, but that\xe2\x80\x99s an additional expense.\nAnother shortcoming of Classic OPC is that it works only on Windows platforms. Today, embedded machines like PLCs and human-machine interfaces generally run real-time operating systems.\nOPC-UA\xe2\x80\x94security for modern industrial environments\nOPC-UA was introduced in 2006 and most recently updated in 2017. The Cisco IoT Security Research Lab recently wrote a technical white paper explaining how it improves Classic OPC, especially in terms of security.\nBriefly, OPC-UA offers three main improvements. It has controls to strengthen industrial security. It works with any operating system, including real-time operating systems. And its flexible data model works in complex environments like electric grids and the industrial IoT. Thanks to this flexibility, OPC-UA has been adopted by groups like the oil and gas industry (MCS-DCS Interface Standard) and the pharmaceutical industry (Open SCS).\nOPC-UA has two layers, each with built-in security. The communication layer establishes a secure channel between the client and server using encryption, signatures, and digital certificates. The application layer authenticates the user and verifies permissions. Security mechanisms can slow down application performance, so OPC-UA gives you the option to turn them on or off to balance performance and security needs.\nFor instance, you might want to implement more security measures in the industrial supervisory or management levels where an OPC server has access to the internet and performance is less important. Conversely, you might want to implement fewer security measures in the industrial process levels where control decisions have to be fast, devices have memory and processing constraints, and security risks are lower because there is no internet access.\nSumming up, upgrading from classic OPC to OPC-UA strengthens IoT/OT security. It gives you the flexibility to connect components running operating systems other than Windows. And it lets you balance OT security against performance based on business needs. For a deep dive into the OPC-UA security model, read our technical white paper.\nTo get the latest industry news on IoT Security delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Security ICS Security IoT Security Lab,"July 28, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520201109-Industrial-Lock-Hero-Image-600x200-1-150x150.png
80,Industrial automation just got simpler,Paul Didier,"b'How can manufacturers accelerate digitization? The payoffs are huge. Think predictive maintenance to reduce operational costs. Or, \xe2\x80\x9cdigital twinning\xe2\x80\x9d to simulate changes to assets or processes and create new business opportunities. Using network devices as sensors to improve cybersecurity. With rewards like this at stake, what\xe2\x80\x99s stopping manufacturers from going all-in on the industrial IoT?\nThe sticking point isn\xe2\x80\x99t connecting assets like robots, cameras, and sensors to industrial switches. That\xe2\x80\x99s now simple, thanks to interoperability standards like Profinet, ODVA, and OPC-UA. The tricky part is what comes next\xe2\x80\x94network management. Operational technology (OT) teams need to prevent unplanned downtime, optimize network performance, and improve security. But they typically don\xe2\x80\x99t have the network management skills or the tools. IT\xe2\x80\x99s tools require lots of expertise to set up and use.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t count the times I heard some version of the following from OT teams:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a network expert.

IT and OT need a common platform that meets both teams\xe2\x80\x99 requirements.\nCisco DNA Center \xe2\x80\x93 common ground for OT and IT\nThe solution is now available with Cisco DNA Center. Cisco DNA Center is a network controller, proven in the largest IT networks over several years. It translates business intent into polices (aka intent-based networking) to automate network functions and improve performance. It\xe2\x80\x99s made IT\xe2\x80\x99s job much simpler\xe2\x80\x94and it can do the same for OT.  Cisco DNA Center gives you the assurance and automation you need to manage the industrial network without deep network expertise. With a few clicks you can configure or update industrial switches, identify the source of problems \xe2\x80\x93 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a network device or connected system, and receive suggested actions for remediation.\nAssurance: quickly see the source of problems, for swift remediation\nSay a factory-floor scanner is acting erratically. The typical protocol today is to log into each industrial switch to look for the problem. Meanwhile, your expensive equipment remains idle for hours. With Cisco DNA Center, you can quickly spot important network problems and see suggested actions. In this case, you might see that that scanner\xe2\x80\x99s port is going up and down more often than normal, a clue that the problem is in the scanner, not the network. Cisco DNA Center might recommend you check the scanner configuration.\nYou can also use Cisco DNA Center to spot brewing problems before they affect production. Using AI/ML, for instance, Cisco DNA Center might learn that network congestion is starting to impact industrial automation traffic and suggest bandwidth upgrades or quality-of-service setting enhancements to maintain network performance for critical industrial applications.\nNetwork automation: configure industrial switches faster, consistently, and at scale\nCisco DNA automation also simplifies management. Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re adding three new manufacturing cells with 50 industrial switches during an overnight downtime window. Manual configuration might take so long you can\xe2\x80\x99t finish on time, delaying production. And just one typo on one industrial switch configuration can cause security vulnerabilities or prevent equipment from connecting to the right VLAN or transmitting the right telemetry information.\nWith Cisco DNA Center, you create a configuration template with the right operating system version, access controls, and settings. Then you apply the template to all switches with a click. Consistent configuration helps OT keep the network working and gives IT the confidence that network and security policies are consistent.\nBring OT and IT together\nOT teams need to know when network issues affect operations and fix problems quickly. IT teams have the experience and network understanding to help. Cisco DNA Center brings both teams together for collaborative solutions. Sounds like heaven to me.\nLearn more\nCisco DNA Center Solution Overview\nAutomation Video\nCisco DNA Assurance At-a-Glance\nSee how Emerson Integrates Cisco DNA Center with IoT Networks\nSubscribe to our newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Network Automation Industrial IoT (IIoT) Manufacturing,"July 22, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192415-padidier-1-150x150.jpg
81,Now is the time to secure industrial operations at scale!,Fabien Maisl,"b'Cyber attacks to industrial organizations and critical infrastructures are now making headlines regularly. As Talos pointed out in a recent research blog, we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered a new world of critical infrastructure security where threat actors are structured businesses.\nNevertheless, few industrial organizations have implemented comprehensive security programs to protect their operational technologies (OT) and even fewer have deployed at scale. At the same time, the pandemic is highlighting how digital transformation can help industries be more agile and transform their infrastructure to operate in the new normal. But for this to happen, industrial networks must have a strong security foundation.\nFor all these reasons, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing heightened demand from industrial organizations all over the world for a new generation of OT security solutions. They all include a mix of similar requirements:\nEasy to deploy throughout the industrial network, without added costs or complexity to the existing infrastructure\nProvide comprehensive visibility into OT devices so security policies can be built for the industrial network\nHelp teams focus on immediate threats so they can prioritize actions and quickly improve the organization\xe2\x80\x99s security posture even if they are not experts in OT or cybersecurity\nScale to massive deployments so that the entire organization can be protected properly\nIntegrate seamlessly with existing IT security tools so that a converged IT/OT security strategy can be implemented.\nWith the release of Cyber Vision 4.0, Cisco is offering a unique OT security solution that addresses these requirements, that will be made available in July 2021.\nEasy deployment in any industrial network\nCyber Vision has always leveraged a unique edge architecture where the OT security solution is embedded in network equipment. This eliminates the need for sourcing, deploying, and managing dedicated security appliances or investing in costly out-of-band collection networks, enabling any industrial organization to easily deploy OT security.\nThis architecture also provides unmatched visibility as passive discovery is achieved at every layer of the network and active discovery requests are not blocked by NAT or firewall boundaries. Cyber Vision 4.0 leverages this massive quantity of data to offer a simplified yet more detailed view of industrial devices, such as rack slot configurations or precise representation of devices with multiple IP or MAC addresses. IT and OT teams now have an even more precise view of what they are defending and can better work together to build more accurate security policies.\nGuidance into urgent security decisions\nCyber Vision 4.0 goes beyond identifying devices. It automatically gives them a risk score to highlight important insights and help prioritize actions. Cyber Vision calculates risks for each device, as well as for data presets so that you can assess the security posture of a specific industrial site, production line or vendor to drive the organization\xe2\x80\x99s security compliance.\nMore than just highlighting risks, Cyber Vision provides guidance on what can be done to proactively lessen them. OT personnel with limited cybersecurity skills, or security experts with no OT expertise can now build effective improvement plans.\nExtending IT security to OT\xe2\x80\xa6 at scale\nCyber Vision\xe2\x80\x99s unique edge architecture enables easy and affordable deployment of OT security features at scale. But the massive amount of data generated must be managed in an efficient manner so that it enriches IT security tools without flooding security analysts or introducing performance issues.\nAs industries accelerate their digitization programs and keep introducing new IoT devices, scalability becomes an issue for OT security solutions. Cyber Vision 4.0 comes with updated foundations to ingest and retain even more data to support the largest deployments. The Cyber Vision Center and Global Center can now also be installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to simplify deployment and scalability of the platform. Setting-up the Cyber Vision Global Center on AWS is a great way to obtain an aggregated view of your industrial sites at a group level.\nCyber Vision 4.0 is building on existing pre-integration with the Cisco Secure portfolio to enable a converged IT/OT security strategy and extend Zero Trust Security to industrial operations. A new app for the Splunk OT add-on allows security analysts to monitor OT security events and build compliance reports in Splunk. Within Cyber Vision, they can now promote events into Cisco SecureX for further investigation leveraging enrichment from other security tools. Cyber Vision 4.0 enables a fully integrated investigation workflow, starting with any SIEM platform, and leveraging your existing IT security tools.\nHow mature is your organization\xe2\x80\x99s OT Security practice?\nTake the IoT/OT Security test\nThen see what you can do with new advances in cyber security!\nTo learn more about how you can secure your IoT/OT infrastructure, visit our IoT Security page or contact us.\nTo get the latest industry news on IoT Security delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Cisco SecureX Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Featured Internet of Things (IoT) Mining Oil and Gas Operational Technology (OT) Utilities,"July 14, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
82,Digital Hope in action – how to create smart and connected communities,Dave Wilson,"b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought a lot about how the ultimate goal of technology is to make the world a better place \xe2\x80\x93 a philosophy I like to call \xe2\x80\x98Digital Hope.\xe2\x80\x99 As VP of Global IoT Sales for Cisco, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the fortunate position to influence how private companies and public agencies deploy our technology to help people. But there is always more to be done.\nWe believe the true purpose of IoT is to eliminate barriers between the digital and physical domains by combining intelligence, automation, management, and security technologies. Together with our industry and cloud partners, we are helping organizations and governments across the globe solve critical issues, secure critical infrastructure, and eliminate digital threats before they\xe2\x80\x99re able to cause harm.\nEnsuring safe drinking water\nAs the water crisis in Flint and the recent attack on treatment plants in Florida demonstrate, maintaining the safety of our drinking supply is critical. The US loses an estimated 6 billion gallons of treated water each day due to aging infrastructure. A necessary step towards safeguarding our water supply is digitizing it through the collection and analysis of data.\nSmart water management means deploying IoT sensors in geographically dispersed treatment facilities to monitor water quality, then feeding the data to a centralized hub via long-range wireless area network gateways. Predictive algorithms can then analyze the data for warning signs of possible equipment failure, allowing plant operators to fix problems before they occur.\nAlbuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, which serves more than 650,000 citizens in New Mexico, has taken proactive steps to avoid potentially lethal cyber attacks on the county\xe2\x80\x99s water infrastructure. By deploying Cisco Industrial Security appliances, Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority is able to segment different components of its IT and OT (operational technology) networks, preventing attacks from discrete IoT components from spreading to the utility\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems.\nCoupled with Cisco Cyber Vision, which uses AI to monitor facility behavior, the county is able to detect potentially adverse events and alert district officials before they become serious issues.\nBridging the digital divide\nOne of the stark lessons brought home by the pandemic was the importance of a reliable internet connection. Our ability to work from home and educate our children is almost entirely dependent on our ability to access the internet. The lack of basic connectivity services for people in poor and rural areas has thrown our nation\xe2\x80\x99s digital divide into stark relief.\nTo narrow this digital divide, we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with local governments to bring broadband to under-served populations, especially students. A recent example of this type of public/private partnership took place in Canutillo Independent School District, northwest of El Paso, Texas.\nIn this town, just miles from the US-Mexico border, 70 percent of its 6,200 students lacked internet access at home. As the pandemic raged and families sheltered in place, these students were in danger of missing an entire year or more of schooling.\nThe school district began by building a private network to share bandwidth among poorer families in the community. Using Cisco Extended Wireless Connectivity \xe2\x80\x93 a solution employing Meraki outdoor access points, Cisco industrial switches, and Fluidmesh ultra-reliable wireless services for back-hauling data \xe2\x80\x93 the district was able to deploy a mesh network called Canutillo Connect that allowed multiple households to tap into the same broadband connection.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also been proud to work with MuralNet, a nonprofit organization devoted to enabling internet access for the 574 sovereign Native American Tribes, to launch the Sustainable Tribal Network. Through financial and technical assistance, Cisco and MuralNet are helping tribes deploy 2.5GHZ spectrum infrastructure to create fixed wireless networks that reach under-served populations on tribal lands.\nLearn more about other company-wide initiatives aimed at connecting rural populations here.\nSmarter decisions, better outcomes\nI highlight these initiatives to raise awareness of what\xe2\x80\x99s possible when we approach technology with a constructive mindset. At Cisco, we are committed to empowering our customers with intelligence, agility, and clarity, across all industries and in all spaces.\nWe in the tech community have the power to make a positive difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives. Our ultimate goal should be to raise happier kids, enable healthier citizens, and to fortify our planet\xe2\x80\x99s aging infrastructure.\nHope\xe2\x80\xa6that\xe2\x80\x99s what gets me out of bed each morning; I hope it does the same for you.\n  Subscribe to our IoT newsletter to keep up with the latest Internet of Things\ntrends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Sensors Smart Cities Utilities Water Utilities,"July 8, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2020/10/Daves-Headshot-150x150.png
83,The heart of your business is at the edge,Vikas Butaney,"b' Three simple reasons you\xe2\x80\x99re going to love our new portfolio to Unite Your Edge\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot about the edge over the last several years. The promise of digitizing the edge data for business value \xe2\x80\x93 like operational efficiencies, improved customer experiences, and business resiliency \xe2\x80\x93 has been delayed by the challenges of managing and securing that edge. With our new line of IoT industrial routing and gateway products launched today, we\xe2\x80\x99re helping you Unite Your Edge with one unified architecture from HQ to the front lines of your operations. Scalable. Flexible. Secure.\nDemystifying the edge\nBut first, let\xe2\x80\x99s set the stage by defining the edge. For us, the edge is not at the campus or branch or headquarters. The edge is all the places where you are serving your customers and generating revenue.\nAnd, while we talk about \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d edge, every business has multiple edges. An electrical utility has substations, distribution automation equipment, meters, service trucks and many other assets. A department of transportation may have intersections, roadways, service fleets, buses, bus stops, trams, and more. Customers have been forced to pick unique products for each of these use cases.\nWhatever industry you are in, you have critical systems and equipment that you need to remotely monitor, control, and extract data from to improve the quality of the product or service you are delivering and lower your operating costs.\nThe challenge with the edge(s)\nWith so many use cases and so much data, we know you face significant hurdles to turn that diverse edge into power.\nComplexity caused by fragmentation\nYou have been forced to use multiple vendors and deploy multiple networks for each use case, none of which have been designed to easily accommodate new technologies. That means you must rip and replace what you have to take advantage of new innovations. Plus, new wireless options like 5G further complicate the edge and its evolution.\nResource constraints\nEach of those point networks requires unique training and skill sets that typically resulted in significant pockets of specialized institutional knowledge. Plus, as you integrate all these networks and take advantage of that edge data knowledge, there is increased pressure on IT to maintain and secure these point networks.\nVulnerabilities and risks\nSecurity grows in importance every day. Recent cyber events have reaffirmed and emphasized the need for extremely tight security as digitization exposes new areas that were previously never connected to the internet \xe2\x80\x93 like those utility meters and traffic controllers. Security needs to be built into IoT networks, not added as an appliance.\nIt all adds up to multiple point networks, with security vulnerabilities, and added burden on your IT and operations teams. But now \xe2\x80\xa6\nUnite your edge\nSolving these significant challenges is exactly why we are launching a whole new portfolio to Unite Your Edge. This portfolio takes the best of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise technology and our extensive industry knowledge base and brings it together into a portfolio purpose-built for any use case.\nLet me tell you the three simple reasons why you are going to love our new portfolio:\nScalable\nThe Network IT already knows: We\xe2\x80\x99ve integrated the best of our enterprise knowledge in IOS XE and management tools that IT is already familiar with, like DNA-C and vManage. As your operational and IT networks are increasingly integrated, you can leverage existing expertise run and maintain your unified networks. Tools purpose-built for industrial settings. Whether a substation, traffic cabinet, bus station, or manufacturing floor, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right technology built for those settings. Plus, operational users can use toolsets built for the operational users, like IoT Operations Dashboard or Field Network Director. Cloud-simple essential connectivity. Plus, our new gateway portfolio delivers connectivity at mass-scale to bring visibility to assets like vending machines, EV charging stations, kiosks, and more.\nFlexible\nYou expect a long life when you deploy products in these operational settings. That\xe2\x80\x99s why our IoT portfolio is built for a lifetime of 7-10+ years. Plus, our new routers provide unprecedented modularity \xe2\x80\x93 Wi-Fi 6, 5G, 4G, Private LTE, FirstNet and Wi-SUN \xe2\x80\x93 to extend the use cases and product life further. Get 5G today and be ready for 6G or whatever the future brings. Even storage is upgradable.\nSecure\nCybersecurity is a foundational capability of this portfolio. Our industrial routers are physically tamperproof, the software is authenticated and protected, and the network encryption uses the latest generation of secure network protocols. We also have integrated our award-winning Cisco Cyber Vision technology into our routers to deliver deeper visibility into industrial communication patterns. Plus, as hybrid and remote environments increasingly become the norm, the portfolio supports secure remote access for operations and equipment monitoring/servicing.\nThe broadest industrial router portfolio on the market\nWith our new routing portfolio, you can have a united architecture across all your diverse edge use cases from HQ to the remote edges. The same rich functionality and robust security models across your entire business \xe2\x80\x93 from your campuses and branch offices to substations, remote operating locations, fleets, on-the-go connected assets, and beyond.\nNow utilities can securely connect their edge to reduce outages, integrate renewables, and improve grid resiliency. Transportation systems providers can optimize routes for first responders and share real-time location and safety information with travelers. Whatever your business, you can connect all your networks with one common architecture and holistic enterprise-wide security approach.\nNo more complexity from point networks. No more rip and replace to capture the latest innovations. No more security loopholes. One unified architecture to get to that richness at the edge of your operations and turn it into business value. To be successful, not just for today and tomorrow, but for many years to come.\nWant to learn more?

84,Edge intelligence for midstream oil and gas operators,Tony Pisani,"b'For midstream oil and gas operators, data flow can be as important as product flow. The operator\xe2\x80\x99s job is to safely move oil and natural gas from its extraction point (upstream), to where it\xe2\x80\x99s converted to fuels (midstream), to customer delivery locations (downstream). During this process, pump stations, meter stations, storage sites, interconnection points, and block valves generate a substantial volume and variety of data that can lead to increased efficiency and safety.\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust one pipeline pump station might have 6 Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), 12 flow computers, and 30 field instruments, and each one is a source of valuable operational information,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Walden, IT and SCADA Director for New Frontier Technologies, a Cisco IoT Design-In Partner that implements OT and IT systems for industrial applications. Until recently, data collection from pipelines was so expensive that most operators only collected the bare minimum data required to comply with industry regulations. That data included pump discharge pressure, for instance, but not pump bearing temperature, which helps predict future equipment failures.\nA turnkey solution to modernize midstream operations\nNow midstream operators are modernizing their pipelines with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions. Cisco and New Frontier Technologies have teamed up to offer a solution combining the Cisco 1100 Series Industrial Integrated Services Router, Cisco Edge Intelligence, and New Frontier\xe2\x80\x99s know-how. Deployed at edge locations like pump stations, the solution extracts data from pipeline equipment and is sent via legacy protocols, transforming data at the edge to a format that analytics and other enterprise applications understand. The transformation also minimizes bandwidth usage.\nMike Walden views the Cisco IR1101 as a game-changer for midstream operators. He shared with me that \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the Cisco IR1101, our customers needed four separate devices to transmit edge data to a cloud server\xe2\x80\x94a router at the pump station, an edge device to do protocol conversion from the old to the new, a network switch, and maybe a firewall to encrypt messages\xe2\x80\xa6With the Cisco IR1101, we can meet all of those requirements with one physical device.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCollect more data, at almost no extra cost\nUsing this IIoT solution, midstream operators can for the first time:\nCollect all available field data instead of just the data on a polling list. If the maintenance team requests a new type of data, the operations team can meet the request using the built-in protocol translators in Edge Intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cCollecting a new type of data takes almost no extra work,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes the operations team look like heroes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCollect data more frequently, helping to spot anomalies. Recording pump discharge pressure more frequently, for example, makes it easier to detect leaks. Interest in predicting (rather than responding to) equipment failure is also growing. The life of pump seals, for example, depends on both the pressure that seals experience over their lifetime and the peak pressures. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you only collect pump pressure every 30 minutes, you probably missed the spike,\xe2\x80\x9d Mike explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do see the spike and replace the seal before it fails, you can prevent a very costly unexpected outage \xe2\x80\x93 saving far more than the cost of a new seal.\xe2\x80\x9d\nProtect sensitive data with end-to-end security. Security is built into the IR1101, with secure boot, VPN, certificate-based authentication, and TLS encryption.\nGive IT and OT their own interfaces so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on the other team. The IT team has an interface to set up network templates to make sure device configuration is secure and consistent. Field engineers have their own interface to extract, transform, and deliver industrial data from Modbus, OPC-UA, EIP/CIP, or MQTT devices.\nAs Mike summed it up, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s finally simple to deploy a secure industrial network that makes all field data available to enterprise applications\xe2\x80\x94in less time and using less bandwidth.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLearn more about New Frontier Technologies\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers edge artificial intelligence Edge Data industrial digitalization Industrial IoT (IIoT) industrial iot solutions Industry 4.0 interconnection internet of things sensors IoT sensors iot technology pump stations SCADA,"June 8, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Tony-Pisani-150x150.jpg
85,The world is ready for 5G. Are you?,Patrick Grossetete,"b'At last, the wait for 5G is nearly over. As this map shows, coverage is widespread across much of the U.S., in 24 EU countries, and in pockets around the globe.\nThe new wireless standard is worth the wait. Compared to 4G, the new wireless standard can move more data from the edge, with less latency. And connect many more users and devices\xe2\x80\x94an important development given that the IDC estimates 152,000 new Internet of Things (IoT) devices per minute by 2025. Put it together, and 5G is a game-changing backhaul for public networks. (Wi-Fi 6, often mentioned in the same breath as 5G, is generally used for private WANs \xe2\x80\x93 e.g., for first responders.)\nGetting ready pays off\nLike the wireless advances that came before it (3G in 2002, 4G in 2009), 5G helps enable businesses to re-imagine operations to increase efficiency. Utilities are planning to put 5G to work for distribution automation and renewable energy management. Fleet operators will stream video from HD security cameras and other IoT devices back to the operations center. The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) plans to connect firefighters, police, and ambulance fleets over 5G backhaul. Manufacturers are getting ready to monitor indoor work environments for safety and health, automate asset tracking inside the factory, and even troubleshoot using augmented reality.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the smartest way to prepare 5G at your network\xe2\x80\x99s edge? Focus on flexibility \xe2\x80\x93 because wireless innovation surely won\xe2\x80\x99t stop with 5G. Buying new routers whenever a new wireless standard is introduced is costly. It ties up IT teams. And leads to environmental waste.\nAs you prepare, look beyond 5G\nWhat if you could future proof your edge network \xe2\x80\x93 getting ready for 5G today and also for whatever advances the future will bring? Most of our customers deploy their industrial networks for as long as 7 to 10 years. Ripping and replacing these devices to accommodate advances \xe2\x80\x93 especially when they are in remote or hard to access places \xe2\x80\x93 is not always possible.\nImagine that you can adapt to new business needs or adopt new standards without buying a whole new router (or hundreds or thousands of them!). You can lower costs and help the environment. And nudge the world closer to a circular economy that makes better use of limited natural resources.\nIntrigued?

86,When your network is “out of the office”: the rewards of industrial connectivity,Paige Kenerson,"b'Question: What do all of these have in common? A) Warehouses and distribution centers. B) Parking garages. C) Outdoor malls. D) Ports and airports.\nAnswer: They\xe2\x80\x99re outside traditional office walls\xe2\x80\x94and real-world showcases for the value of industrial networking. Think IP cameras, badge readers, conveyors, sorters, and other IoT sensors. Popular payoffs for industrial networking include improving safety and security, increasing efficiency with automation, and creating great customer and employee experiences.\nThink about a business that sells vehicles on consignment. Rather than making buyers and sellers trudge across the parking lot to the office on a hot or rainy day, the company can set up industrial Wi-Fi access points to provide wireless connectivity in the parking lot. Now staff can use mobile devices to make appraisals and complete sales right from the lot.\nPicture an outdoor mall operator looking to deliver a great experience for shoppers and reduce energy consumption. With industrial wireless, the mall operator can offer guest Wi-Fi, monitor IP camera feeds to increase safety, and use energy more efficiently with power-over-Ethernet lighting.\nHow about a large e-commerce distribution center that automates inventory and asset tracking by using sorters and conveyors to read package IDs? Or a port that remotely controls cranes and automatically alerts shippers when sensors detect changes in land and water traffic?\nWhat it takes: secure, scalable, and rugged connectivity\nEvery one of those scenarios is happening today. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to extend the Cisco \xe2\x80\x9cindoor network\xe2\x80\x9d you already know and trust to connect assets in outdoor or industrial areas. Cisco Industrial Networking provides:\nSecurity. Connecting thousands of assets increases the threat surface. Our industrial products help keep out malware with visibility and automated enforcement of access policies.\nScalability. The same size staff can manage exponentially more devices with the same tools they use for enterprise networks, such as Cisco DNA Center.\nRuggedness. Cisco industrial network devices are engineered to withstand extreme temperatures, shock and vibration, and water and dust.\nChange? Bring it on.\nAs the last year has shown, events ranging from a public health crisis to a beached cargo ship can upend the business. Agility is crucial. With our Industrial Ethernet products, adding new devices in new locations doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require new management tools or processes. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re connecting an access point or sensor in a corner office, a chilly warehouse, or the basement of a parking structure, provisioning and management are the same. So you can shorten deployment cycles and move with more confidence and agility as conditions change and opportunities arise.\nI invite you to try it out!

87,NERC CIP Compliance: What you should know,Dave Schmitt,"b'The North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) compliance program has been in place for many years. Most North American power utilities already have some level of adherence. However, as technology and cybersecurity concerns advance, the requirements are frequently updated and are becoming more prescriptive.\nWith the recent updates and mandates for NERC CIP 13 (related to supply chain management) and increased interest in NERC CIP 7 (related to systems security management), we have seen a significant uptake in questions from customers and requests for assistance with audits and responses. To make things easier on everyone, we recently published a white paper explaining NERC CIP requirements and mapping grid security solutions, techniques, and services to the requirements.\nOn June 2nd, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be presenting on the key elements of this white paper in a live webcast. Together with Sunil Maryala, we\xe2\x80\x99ll demonstrate solutions that can help achieve compliance. Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss the event. Register now!\nThe prospect of a NERC CIP audit can be intimidating, time consuming, and costly. The burden grows exponentially when grid operators manage heterogeneous environments consisting of point solutions and proprietary systems that aren\xe2\x80\x99t integrated. In addition to standard reports, auditors often request additional proof of compliance while on site. The idea behind these last minute or ad-hoc requests is to see the processes and practices in action and to confirm that the organization\xe2\x80\x99s plan and documentation are in fact comprehensive and aligned.\nA holistic security architecture with proven integration reduces the cost and operational overhead associated with achieving and demonstrating compliance. Ideally, IT and operational technology (OT) are aligned around security, with IT correctly adapted for the operational network. This allows operators to leverage the experience and systems within IT. A well thought-out, implemented, and operationally-effective security posture requires a partnership between IT and OT, and starts at the foundation \xe2\x80\x94 the network.\nAlong with our NERC CIP white paper, Cisco solutions engineers have designed a comprehensive architecture for grid security and NERC CIP compliance with systems that are proven to work together. The Grid Security Cisco Validated Design (CVD) is regularly updated to include new compliance requirements, technologies and best practices. It provides a validated blueprint for our utility customers to build secure networks while addressing their compliance concerns by aligning to NERC CIP mandates.\nWith this white paper and CVD, our goal is to assist and support utility organizations with a comprehensive and validated network architecture that addresses cybersecurity at the core of the solution.  Additionally, the solution compliance requirements are layered with reliability improvements for the grid. The solution is cost effective and sensitive to both Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) concerns of a utility operator.\nFor a better understanding of what the NERC CIP program includes and how Cisco can assist you to achieve compliance, have a look at our new white paper.

88,Cisco Live takeaways: IT and operations team up,Patrick Grossetete,"b'A common theme cropped up at the last Cisco Live!, held virtually from March 31 to April 1, 2021. I\xe2\x80\x99d sum it up like this: IT improves operations only if operational teams will use the solutions. Ease-of-use and reliability rule!\nIf you were one of the more than 100,000 people who attended, you probably heard some version of that message. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my take on how it showed through in sessions on multi-access wireless technologies, cybersecurity, and operational management \xe2\x80\x93 some of this year\xe2\x80\x99s most popular topics.\nWireless: IT and operations teams have different priorities\nLines were out the door (virtually, that is!) for sessions describing wireless technologies and the evolution from low to high data rates. We heard the latest on LoRaWAN, Wi-SUN (Field Area Network), public or private LTE, Wi-Fi 6, 5G, and Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (formerly Fluidmesh). When selecting Wireless for industrial Internet of Things (IoT) use cases, IT and operations teams have different priorities. IT looks for top performance based on the type of asset (moving, battery-operated, densely packed). But for operations people, stability and ease of use often outweigh raw performance. Their goal is to keep the business running, whether that means manufacturing widgets, running trains, moving containers, distributing electricity, and more.\nSession presenters talked about how to meet both teams\xe2\x80\x99 needs.  Take Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul, which is designed to connect \xe2\x80\x9con the move\xe2\x80\x9d assets to critical applications. These assets can be found on rails, at terminals, or in mines, to name a few. In addition to providing fiber-like performance (the goal for IT teams), it simplifies operations with easy installation and a web management interface. For more, watch the session and check out this blog by my colleague Umberto Malesci.\nCybersecurity: shared interest for OT and IT\nThis year, always-popular cybersecurity sessions attracted many more OT specialists in addition to the IT regulars. Attendees tuned in for the latest on protecting IoT devices like security cameras and manufacturing systems from cyberattacks that can cause quality problems or interrupt operations. A main takeaway is that OT security takes more than a single protocol (e.g., DNP3, ModBus, or BACnet). More than a single layer. More than a single product. Effective security requires multiple solutions and automated actions based on policies.\nHighlighting that point, in a session about increasing your industrial security posture and the Journey Towards a Secure Industrial Network, presenters described extending IT security to OT by integrating IoT sensors with the platform and providing context for policy-based decisions. As an example of context, an IT device (like a printer) that\xe2\x80\x99s under attack will almost always be shut down or disconnected from the network. But before shutting down an OT system like a programmable logic controller (PLC), staff need to estimate the impact on operations, take the right steps to protect production, and weigh any disruption against the potential costs of the attack.\nOperational management: finding common ground for IT and operations\nTraditional network management tools are designed for IT people, who are on a first-name basis with things like ACLs, QoS, and SGTs. But the people in charge of operations for utilities, transportation, smart cities, etc. aren\xe2\x80\x99t always networking engineers. They just want quick ways to identify faults, isolate them, and restore service, always keeping operations in mind.\nTo meet both teams\xe2\x80\x99 needs, we demonstrated a new workflow approach for IoT operations management called Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. It\xe2\x80\x99s a single place where operations teams can go to deploy, operate, and make sense of data from industrial assets. One of my favorite sessions (here) included a demo of Cisco Edge Intelligence running on a Cisco IR1101 router. Watch this demo see how a water management team would use it for insights from IoT devices such as flow meters, leak detectors, and quality sensors.\nAnother personal favorite, Asset and Facility Monitoring at Scale, described a fast, simple way to start monitoring industrial assets and facilities. Cisco Industrial Asset Vision includes everything you need: sensors (temperature, humidity, vibration, occupancy, etc.), a LoRaWAN gateway, and the IoT Operations Dashboard Assets Management services. It\xe2\x80\x99s already integrated, and set up is as simple as scanning a QR code.\nI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll join us at the next Cisco Live! event. Stay tuned for the schedule here.\nIf you registered for Cisco Live! 2021, you can still view more than 150 Anytime Sessions here, through July 2, 2021.\nKeep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and insights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.

89,Securing industrial networks: it’s a journey,Vikram Sharma,"b'When I meet with manufacturers, I usually hear some version of the following: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re digitizing to get real-time visibility into production and improved operational equipment effectiveness. But now we\xe2\x80\x99re worried about malware interrupting operations. What can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\nNews headlines have erased any doubts about the need for industrial network cybersecurity. The trickier question is how to secure the network without interrupting production and revenue. To provide guidance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created Cisco Validated Designs for industrial network security. They lay out a step-by-step approach to gain visibility into OT assets, protect against and respond to threats, and enhance IT and OT collaboration.\nBringing IT and OT together is a journey\nTrying to secure the industrial network in one go is like boiling the ocean. Better to view it as a journey. At each step in the journey, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make incremental changes to people, process, and technology.\nStep 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Minimal security. This is the current state for most manufacturers. If you\xe2\x80\x99re here, you\xe2\x80\x99ve segmented the industrial network from the IT network. Traffic can\xe2\x80\x99t cross from the IT network to the industrial network without clearing the DMZ. You can block malware from entering the industrial network. You can block malware from leaving the industrial network to infect the enterprise network. But if the industrial network is exposed to malicious software, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to contain it. That means the malware might affect multiple manufacturing cells or production lines \xe2\x80\x94 even multiple plants.\nStep 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Foundational security. Here\xe2\x80\x99s where most of our customers start. The watchwords at this step are detect, protect, and respond:\nIdentify all your industrial assets, known vulnerabilities of those assets and communication flows. Cisco Cyber Vision makes this simple, and gives IT and OT teams a common vocabulary and context because zones correspond to production lines or manufacturing cells. With this visibility provided by Cisco Cyber Vision, industrial network segmentation can be done optimally.\nDetect threats and prevent them from spreading by deploying a Cisco ISA 3000 Industrial Security Appliance.\nInvestigate and remediate threats with Cisco SecureX. When you build the security policy, the OT team specifies the right response, depending on the zone. In some cases, the business cost of taking down assets in an infected zone might exceed the risk of the infection. In other cases, the opposite might be true.\nCreate containment zones for malware to prevent it from spreading across zones. This requires detection rules and flow control policies. Manage rules and policies consistently with Firepower Management Center for all deployed ISAs.\nFoundational security also requires changes to processes. OT security is treated like a maintenance process included in planned maintenance schedules \xe2\x80\x94 for example, \xe2\x80\x9cCheck if firmware needs updates because of a vulnerability.\xe2\x80\x9d At this stage there is a need to develop workflows between security operations and manufacturing operations.\nStep 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Full-spectrum security. After foundation security has been successfully operationalized, the segmentation capabilities are enhanced in full-spectrum security architecture. Segmentation can be granular down to single devices and zero-trust capabilities can be deployed into the industrial network. This makes the malware containment zones down to a single device while providing fine grain control over which asset communication flows. Visibility is enhanced by adding anomaly detection with Cisco Stealthwatch, and block sensor-to-cloud communication requests to malicious websites with Cisco Umbrella.\nOrder matters\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get the most value from your investments in factory security by taking the steps I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined in order. To explain why, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you an analogy from cooking, my hobby. When I bake a cake, I decide on the base (vanilla, chocolate, etc.) before the icing. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that icing by itself isn\xe2\x80\x99t good\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just much better as an enhancement to the cake. Similarly, Stealthwatch (step 3) is valuable at any time. But it\xe2\x80\x99s far more useful if you already have a complete OT asset inventory (step 2) and operational processes. Those elements set you up to efficiently investigate and respond to events and incidents raised by Stealthwatch.\nLearn more\nWant to learn more?

90,Smart buildings: is BACnet a secure protocol?,IoT Security Research Lab,"b'If you don\xe2\x80\x99t already work in a \xe2\x80\x9csmart building,\xe2\x80\x9d chances are that you will soon. By 2025, more than 75% of new construction will fit this category\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s not counting existing buildings. Connecting building systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, physical access controls, and fire detection to the IP network can increase energy efficiency, health, comfort, and safety.\nBut smart building networks need security protections. Attacks on a building controllers can shut down heating in the middle of a cold winter. Tampering with environmental sensors can trigger alarms or automated actions putting life or property at risk. And hackers can use connected building automation systems as a foothold to access business applications and critical data.\nBACnet wasn\xe2\x80\x99t designed with security in mind\nWith an estimated 60% market share, BACnet is the most popular industrial protocol in smart buildings, used by more than 100 building systems vendors. But like other building protocols (e.g., KNX, LonWorks), BACnet was not designed with security in mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s susceptible to attacks such as denial of service, message spoofing, network recognition attacks, and others.\nWe in Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT Security Research Lab just published a white paper explaining how BACnet works, and its security weaknesses. In this blog we\xe2\x80\x99ll summarize three approaches to securing BACnet, with pros and cons.\n1) Intrusion detection using network telemetry\nOne approach is to study the size and number of packets flowing across the BACnet, Ethernet, and IP layers. Statistically comparing current network activity against the norm helps identify certain types of attacks\xe2\x80\x94for example, denial-of-service attacks that flood building systems so they can\xe2\x80\x99t respond to real messages. But statistical measures of packet volume or frequency might miss targeted attacks that use only a few messages. An example is an attack manipulating physical variables such as the temperature in a regulated environment.\n2) Using a rule-based induction algorithm\nAnother approach is to classify network flows as legitimate or not legitimate, using a rule-based induction algorithm such as RIPPER. Training these algorithms involves presenting them with numerous legitimate and illegitimate BACnet messages\xe2\x80\x94say, from the fire detection system. Learning from examples, the algorithm builds rules to single out illegitimate messages. RIPPER\xe2\x80\x99s shortcoming is that it can only detect attacks that alter expected flow behavior. An attack modifying BACnet Write-Property messages, for example, might slip through.\n3) Creating rules from BACnet files\nInstead of building rules with machine learning (as described above) you can build them from the information contained in a building system\xe2\x80\x99s BACnet network specification and configuration files. These files specify allowed objects, allowed values for object properties, and supported services. Messages with values outside these constraints are flagged as suspicious. The drawback? Rules don\xe2\x80\x99t have context. In a targeted attack, the  attacker might be able to alter the physical process without deviating from the constraints.\nA look forward\nAll three intrusion-detection approaches we\xe2\x80\x99ve summarized here are good at detecting \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy\xe2\x80\x9d BACnet attacks, such as denial of service. But they might not be as effective against targeted attacks designed to alter a physical process. The global cybersecurity community is working on solutions.\nIn the meantime, you can start strengthening security now by monitoring system activities with a solution like Cisco Cyber Vision. Seeing how building automation systems connect to your networks lets you isolate them from your IT domain. And by establishing a baseline for system behavior, Cyber Vision can detect anomalies and trigger alarms so that staff can take immediate action.\nTo learn more on BACnet security, have a look at our research white paper.\nFor more technical reports on IoT/OT Security, visit the IoT Security Research Lab web page and subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: #Security BACnet BMS Cisco Cyber Vision Internet of Things (IoT) IoT Security Lab smart buildings,"April 6, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520201109-Industrial-Lock-Hero-Image-600x200-1-150x150.png
91,Cisco IoT delivers double digit growth across industries,Vikas Butaney,"b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re like me, this last year has left me with an odd sense of time \xe2\x80\x93 where the 2020 lockdown seems both like yesterday and a decade ago. We all know how challenging it has been to balance work, life, families, and more.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been fortunate to be in an industry that has made a real impact across all those vectors. We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing IoT deliver increased business resiliency, better jobs, improved working conditions, increased efficiency, and a higher quality of work/life balance. And we\xe2\x80\x99re challenging ourselves to make improvements across our own business \xe2\x80\x93 like reducing our own environmental footprint with a circular design approach.\nCisco IoT is at the heart of many critical industries \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in our double-digit growth in key areas, with a 16% growth in discrete manufacturing, 12% growth in utilities, and 10% growth in public sector industries. And this growth in IoT isn\xe2\x80\x99t just Cisco. We heard at the Cisco Magnetic IoT Start-Up Summit that there is a significant rise in IoT investments \xe2\x80\x93 with 3x more capital being invested in industrial IoT in 2020.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 2020 and into 2021, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing critical industries, like manufacturing and utilities, dramatically increase their digital investments. What may have started as an urgent response to a new Covid-19 reality is transforming into a business accelerator,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Prouty, group vice president of IDC\xe2\x80\x99s Manufacturing and Energy Insights. \xe2\x80\x9cThis double-digit growth that Cisco IoT is seeing aligns with the increasing importance of a secure and resilient digital industrial infrastructure, particularly for these critical industries.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHow did we achieve this growth? With the collaboration of great customers, amazing partners, and Cisco IoT teams, we\xe2\x80\x99re transforming critical industries and improving lives by bringing IT to the physical world to increase business resiliency and employee safety.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at some of the best from this last year.\nCritical industries are thriving with IoT-powered innovation\nThe IoT opportunity is everywhere and expanding rapidly. Businesses are investing in IoT across industries \xe2\x80\x93 taking their existing networks and extending to the industrial settings. They are building secure, resilient autonomous industrial operations to thrive in the post-Covid recovery.\nHere are just a few industries where we are making a huge impact:\nManufacturing. Recent research indicates that Covid-19 has sped the adoption of digital technologies by several years. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that reflected in our manufacturing customers across industrial goods, consumer products, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers are upgrading their plant environment and driving cybersecurity deeper into the network to protect from malware and other exploits.\nUtilities: Utilities are turning to IoT to accelerate their modernization efforts, increase efficiency and reliability, and enable use of renewable energy sources. As they connect and automate their substations, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing more and more utilities focus their attention on bringing higher levels of security to this critical infrastructure.\nPublic sector: We are seeing huge growth in connected intersections, corridors and communities \xe2\x80\x93 like the Virginia Department of Transportation making driving safer for residents and first responders leveraging AT&T FirstNet LTE connectivity for emergency traffic prioritization. We\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing critical public infrastructures, like the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, working with Cisco IoT to modernize technology and secure operations.\nTransportation: Across rail and mass transit, roadways, and ports, customers are using our IoT solutions to improve the customer experience, drive efficiencies, create safer working environments, and move to automation. One great example is Malta Freeport Terminals, a global shipping hub that to turned to Cisco for our Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul to enable their assets to move freely anywhere in the port.\nAccelerating innovation with Industry Blueprints and Design-In Program\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re helping our customers and partners speed the time to success with our Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs). Think of CVDs as blueprints for industry-specific solutions like connected communities, industrial automation, distribution automation, and more. For every CVD, our engineers create detailed design and implementation guides with pre-tested and validated reference architectures across Cisco and our partners\xe2\x80\x99 products. Before you start, be sure to check our 50+ design and implementation guides to lower your risk and accelerate your implementation.\nOver this last year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also had dozens of partners \xe2\x80\x93 Industrial Control System (ICS) vendors, Machine Builders, Building Automation System vendors, Smart Instrumentation vendors, and Rail Integrators \xe2\x80\x93 join the 40+ companies already in our Design-In Program. With our open ecosystem approach, documented best practices, and implementation roadmaps, these Design-In partners are using Cisco networking products, embedded boards, and edge software to digitize their products and services quickly, without compromising on security.\nThe foundation? A secure and reliable industrial network\nWe know that IoT solutions have many layers. Customers need to feed their analytics and applications data that is latent in machines, controllers, and sensors down at the floor level. A secure industrial network is a critical element to make this happen.\nFor our Cisco IT networking customers, our industrial networking products will look very familiar. Our switching and routing products run the same IOS-XE software and our Wi-Fi access points run the same OS.\nPlus, all of the training and skills from the traditional IT enterprise portfolio is directly replicable to the industrial networking portfolio.\nThis year we\xe2\x80\x99ve also introduced new technologies beyond our core networking product lines. Our new sensor networking solution \xe2\x80\x93  Industrial Asset Vision (IAV) \xe2\x80\x93 allows us to connect battery-powered sensors over short and long distances, giving you additional data for those apps and analytics. And we connect all these products with an automation capability. So, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented Cisco DNA Center and you are providing assurance and automation to your carpeted spaces, you can extend the same capabilities into new operational domains with our IoT products.\nDeep visibility into the network for industrial-grade security\nThis year also has brought IT and OT together to build a converged security strategy. Cisco Cyber Vision \xe2\x80\x93 cybersecurity designed for the Industrial IoT \xe2\x80\x93 is helping accelerate that trend.\nCyber Vision is delivering deep visibility into plant floors, substations, and more. It\xe2\x80\x99s also enabling IT and OT to share security data with other platforms, like Cisco DNA Center, so that you can create and apply a single security policy \xe2\x80\x93 just like you\xe2\x80\x99d do if you were using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) in the carpeted space.\nCongrats to Cyber Vision for winning this year\xe2\x80\x99s Frost & Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s IoT/OT Cybersecurity Best Practices Award! Curious? Take a look.\nThe IIoT edge is open for business\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cedge\xe2\x80\x9d is a topic that comes up in many different settings. At Cisco IoT, our focus is on integrating the edge capability right into our networking products.\nWith Cisco Edge Intelligence, you can extract the data from a controller, a machine, roadway intersections, and more \xe2\x80\x93 and create logic right at the edge of the network.\nTake whatever data you want and integrate it from that IoT edge to cloud platforms, like Azure IoT or AWS, or to your on-prem environment.\nThe great thing is that Cisco is cloud neutral, offering multi-cloud integration capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 so customers, partners, and developers can bring the data wherever they want to analyze data and serve up new capabilities.\nCome learn more at Cisco LIVE 2021\nJoin us at Cisco Live 2021 Turn It Up from March 30 \xe2\x80\x93 April 1 for inspiration, education, and some fun.

92,Fluidmesh is now Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul and Winner of 2021 IoT Breakthrough Award,Umberto Malesci,"b'Asking what\xe2\x80\x99s the best wireless technology is like asking what\xe2\x80\x99s the best pasta shape. Answer: it depends. For pasta, the variable is the sauce\xe2\x80\x94tubes for chunky sauces, strands for oils or creamy sauces. (Source: being Italian, and Bon Apetit.)\nFor wireless, the best technology depends on your application (tolerance for latency, packet loss, and dropped connection) and assets (where they are and how fast they\xe2\x80\x99re moving). Based on those answers, you might be best off with Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, public or private LTE, Wi-Fi 6, or 5G where it\xe2\x80\x99s available. Cisco has solutions for all of these options.\nBut none of the wireless technologies I\xe2\x80\x99ve listed above reliably connects assets on the move to critical applications that can\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate packet loss or latency of more than a few milliseconds. To understand why that\xe2\x80\x99s important, imagine remotely monitoring and controlling moving assets on trains, subways, public transit, mines, or ports. If a few packets drop while you\xe2\x80\x99re checking email, no one notices. In contrast, dropped packets when you\xe2\x80\x99re remotely controlling a crane or autonomous vehicle can have serious consequences.\nIoT Breakthrough award\nTo provide ultra-reliable, low latency connectivity, Cisco acquired Fluidmesh in July 2020. Today, the market intelligence firm IoT Breakthrough gave a shout out to the acquisition by naming us the \xe2\x80\x9cM2M Network Equipment Company of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d in 2021. Now in its fifth year, the IoT Breakthrough Awards program recognizes innovators, leaders, and visionaries from around the globe in multiple IoT categories. We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to have been selected for the award from a field of more than 3,850 nominees around the world.\nFluidmesh is now Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nTo highlight what makes Fluidmesh unique, we\xe2\x80\x99re changing its name to Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul. New name, same specs. Up to 500Mbps dedicated bandwidth. Negligible latency. No packet loss during handoffs even when assets are moving at up to 350 kpm (217 mph). Five-nines availability. And no service provider fees, because you own the network. James Johnson, managing director of IoT Breakthrough, spelled out the innovation when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul extends the company\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in industrial wireless to include on-the-move applications where reliable backhaul is mission critical.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn action\nThe best way I know to show how Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul is transforming operations is to point to our customers. In Lyon, France, rail operator SYTRAL is improving passenger safety by monitoring feeds from more than 1000 IP cameras\xe2\x80\x94at any train speed. Malta Freeport Terminals controls cranes and yard equipment up to 800 meters away at 50 to 60 Mbps\xe2\x80\x94with zero packet loss. In Milan, Italy, Hitachi Rail (previously Ansaldo STS) runs a completely driverless metro line enabled by communications-based train control (CBTC). Other customers use our Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul for remote machine operations, SCADA backhaul, and emergency response systems.\nLike pasta recipes, new use cases just keep emerging.

93,"Part 2: Manufacturers, it’s time to reboot network security",Kevin Turek,"b'In a \xe2\x80\x9cPart 1\xe2\x80\x9d of this blog series, my colleague Paul Didier explained why manufacturers are accelerating transformation of their legacy production networks. In short, a modern network can readily enable integrated end-to-end cybersecurity \xe2\x80\x93 making it much easier to proactively monitor, identify and mitigate threats. In this post, I step through more of the \xe2\x80\x9chow,\xe2\x80\x9d with for designing, planning, testing and deploying new switches as part of a network transformation.\nWhen planning a transformation, start with a thorough understanding of all requirements for the applications and services the production network supports. Dive deep into all protocols and associated KPIs and metrics required by the deployed endpoints and analyzing industrial automation and control systems (IACS) devices, many of which tend to be sensitive to network latency and loss. Once the requirements are well understood, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to develop role-based templates and network device configurations. These configurations will reflect the protocols and features necessary to support deterministic behavior, application SLAs and current device connectivity.\nAfter the device configurations are developed, the next step is testing and validating the viability of those configurations in the new switches. This can be achieved by executing a limited proof of concept in a controlled \xe2\x80\x9csandbox\xe2\x80\x9d or by testing within a limited production environment. In either case, the key is to execute tests and expose the equipment to the rigors and network characteristics found in the operational environment while minimizing any impact to operations. Using clear pass/fail criteria for each feature, validate that all requirements are being met and that the network performs as expected. After completing all tests \xe2\x80\x93 and resolving any punch-list items \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s time to displace the legacy switches.\nDifferent situations and operations may dictate how the displacement or migration needs to be executed. This, too, requires strict planning and preparation. To properly execute the migration and ensure successful repeatability for subsequent devices, create a standard operating procedure (SOP) or methods of procedure (MOP) document. This document defines the step-by-step process and correct sequence for performing necessary tasks. As such, it helps mitigate risk and reduce impact to operations \xe2\x80\x93 by defining not only the proper procedures for executing the displacement, but also the backout procedures should something unexpected be encountered.\nTo further contain costs and impact, default to reusing existing cabling and power, which usually represent the most significant cost and time to deploy a production network. Using existing power and network cabling helps minimize the time required to swap network infrastructure hardware.\nWhile manufacturers often possess the staff and experience in performing these tasks, resources may be spread thin. In that case, look to Cisco CX as a force multiplier, mitigating risk and helping drive success. Cisco CX is capable of performing one, some or all of the tasks discussed to help achieve the desired outcome, such as minimizing operational downtime and/or minimizing costs and keeping the project on schedule.\nFast-tracking cyber solutions\nOnce a legacy network is displaced with a security-capable network infrastructure, manufacturers can move more quickly on the journey to secure production environments.  With a transformed legacy network, a manufacturer can accelerate deployment of cybersecurity solutions that lead to more uptime and secured assets and products.\nHere are four ways to start:\nMonitor IACS devices and communication and identify risks. Leverage cybersecurity applications such as Cisco Cyber Vision to analyze data collected by the new network equipment to gain ubiquitous visibility.\nLeverage Cisco Cyber Vision to profile industrial devices, group them into production cells and define security policies between those cells.\nMonitor communications between production cells to confirm security policies are properly defined and can be enforced without compromising production.\nDeploy security policies to be enforced by the new industrial network and provide ongoing improvements with Cisco DNA-C network management offerings and improved cybersecurity operations with Cisco SecureX.\nIntegrate these steps with other key cybersecurity initiatives that rely on the transformed production networks. These may include policy management, secure remote access, enhanced industrial de-militarized zones, malware protection throughout the environment, and intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS) at key conduits within the production zone.\nThe current fragmented cybersecurity approach in industrial environments is not keeping pace with the rate and sophistication of threats and attacks. To avoid downtime, revenue loss and reputational impact, manufacturers should consider transforming legacy production networks and migrating to a more capable infrastructure, such as one provided by the Cisco Industrial Ethernet platform.\nThe Cisco IE3x000 series together with Cisco Cyber Vision provides deep insights and visibility of IACS devices and communication patterns. This approach also enables segmentation and defense tailored to the existing IACS by leveraging increased visibility to derive tailored cybersecurity profiles. These profiles can subsequently be used to define and instantiate security policies.\nWith a modern network and more integrated security tools and features, manufacturers can expect to upgrade and deliver a more comprehensive and cohesive cybersecurity posture throughout the lifecycle of the IACS and production networks.\nTo learn more on how a modern industrial network can help you scale your OT cybersecurity strategy, read our whitepaper on the various architectural approaches available to you.\nShare'",Tags: Cybersecurity IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing network security,"March 9, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Kevin-Turek-150x150.png
94,"Part 1: Manufacturers, it’s time to reboot network security",Paul Didier,"b'Even before the drastic changes we saw as a result of 2020, manufacturers were under pressure to improve operational efficiency through digital transformation. While investments in digital transformation pay dividends, they also compound longstanding cybersecurity risks. When manufacturing operations are digitized and interconnected, there\xe2\x80\x99s more potential exposure and greater need for proactive protection. After all, a single cybersecurity incident can drive downtime and revenue loss, rack up operational expenses and damage a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s reputation in the market.\nAnd yet, even as cybersecurity continues to remain a board-level concern, many manufacturers continue to address the risks with patchwork approaches. Security can\xe2\x80\x99t be achieved with point solution. It takes an end-to-end approach \xe2\x80\x93 starting with the network.\nYes, there are some excellent cybersecurity tools designed especially for operational technology (OT) environments. They promise to identify devices and their communication patterns, thereby surfacing cybersecurity risks. But these tools are only as effective as the network they\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring. Legacy networks often make it complex to gain the needed visibility and impossible to automate application and enforcement of security policies.\nTo enable secure digital transformation, manufacturers need to reboot network security. That starts with fast-tracking transformation of legacy production networks so they fully enable and enhance cybersecurity tools.\nSwitching for security\nFor any manufacturer, the production network is the foundation of a secure and reliable production environment. The network should provide security tools with seamless access to production systems and their communications. With the proper network hardware and software, security tools can serve as security \xe2\x80\x9ceyes and ears\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 sensing and analyzing industrial automation and control systems (IACS) devices and communications at the edge. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the security tools should be able to perform that work without placing undue burden on the network itself.\nAs it does in enterprise networks, the production network can also play a critical defensive role.  With access to IACS devices and communications, OT security tools can help \xe2\x80\x9cprofile\xe2\x80\x9d device behaviors and communication flows. Manufacturers can use these profiles to develop security policies, which can subsequently be enforced via the network infrastructure.\nUsing those same profiles, software can apply dynamic network segmentation \xe2\x80\x93 making it easy to protect a flat industrial network from anomalous communication flows and malicious traffic. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cybersecurity journey we highlighted in greater detail in our \xe2\x80\x9cSecuring Industrial Networks\xe2\x80\x9d solution brief.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Ethernet line of switches, especially the revamped modular IE3x00 switches, provide resilient networking and rich cybersecurity capabilities that are a foundation for digital transformation. They embed the Cisco Cyber Vision sensor to provide comprehensive visibility on industrial assets and communications and TrustSec to enforce device-level segmentation according to security policies created by Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).\nThe IE3x00 series is an ideal platform to easily secure production systems at scale, far exceeding the capabilities of legacy production networks. It\xe2\x80\x99s well suited to displacing legacy network equipment to enable a more tightly integrated end-to-end security strategy.\nOf course, transforming an existing network is not a trivial undertaking. Given the 24/7/365 operational tempo of many production environments, there is significant risk if a migration is poorly executed. Before displacing any existing network devices, manufacturers need to perform sufficient planning, testing and preparation to minimize potential downtime (planned and unplanned).\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cPart 2\xe2\x80\x9d of this blog series, my colleague Kevin Turek will share detailed recommendations for manufacturers making the strategic decision to reboot their production network \xe2\x80\x93 and dramatically improve cybersecurity. In the meantime, read our whitepaper to learn more on how a modern industrial network can help you scale your OT cybersecurity strategy.\n  Share'",Tags: automation and control systems Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cybersecurity Digital transformation IIoT Industrial Internet of Things Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing network infrastructure network security OT,"March 2, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192415-padidier-1-150x150.jpg
95,A simpler way to move data from the network’s edge to Amazon Web Services,Samuel Pasquier,"b'Data has been called \xe2\x80\x9cthe new oil.\xe2\x80\x9d And like oil, it needs to be extracted, processed, and delivered before it has value. Customers have told me how overwhelming the process is when thousands of devices at the network\xe2\x80\x99s edge transmit over multiple protocols and report the same data differently (e.g., metric v English measurements). And even after you\xe2\x80\x99ve solved those problems, moving all Internet of Things data to the cloud for analytics tends to be too costly, especially over cellular networks.\nThe trick is securely moving the right data to the cloud, in a consistent format.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to announce that Cisco and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have collaborated on an integration between AWS IoT Core and Cisco Edge Intelligence software. Cisco Edge Intelligence, which runs on our award-winning industrial gateways, provides a complete solution to move the data that matters from the industrial edge to the AWS Cloud\xe2\x80\x94simply, securely, and at scale.\nToppling the barriers to converting edge data to insights\nFor a real-world view of the problem we\xe2\x80\x99re solving, imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring factory-floor robot vibration, vehicle telemetry, or wind turbine speed for preventive maintenance. To get the right data to the cloud you need to answer these questions: What data matters and which is irrelevant? How can I transform data from different vendors\xe2\x80\x99 IoT devices so it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent\xe2\x80\x94for example, all temperatures in C\xc2\xb0 instead of F\xc2\xb0? How can we store data and make it available to other systems and business teams? What happens when we need to scale the process for more devices from more vendors? How can we harness the power of the network between the edge and the cloud to minimize hardware investments? How do we ensure that our data is secure at every stage of the journey?\nAll-in-one solution to extract, transform, govern, and deliver data to AWS\nThe new integration solves all of those challenges by making it simpler to extract, transform, govern, and deliver edge data to AWS. Extracting the right data is simpler because popular machine protocols are built right into Edge Intelligence software, saving you from doing the integration work.\nUse the same interface to transform data to make it consistent. For example, you may want to only send data that falls above or below a certain threshold, in order to run predictive maintenance algorithms. You can also specify that all temperatures should be expressed as C\xc2\xb0 even if some vendors\xe2\x80\x99 sensors report them as F\xc2\xb0.\nBefore moving the transformed data to the cloud, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to define data governance policies, rules about where particular elements of your data can be delivered. This protection gives you flexibility not only to keep your data safe but also to define at the granular level what information goes where. This feature allows you to inform more than one data instance on AWS without compromising control.\nWith governance in place, you can deliver data to AWS IoT Core with a click. The web-based management interface allows you to specify continued or scheduled data delivery. Edge Intelligence uses a just-in-time provisioning workflow to seamlessly provision Cisco gateway and associated device certificates into AWS IoT Core Registry. Once a gateway is provisioned, you can start sending data to AWS IoT Core. Actions can be performed on the data using Rules for AWS IoT to transform, filter, enrich, and route data in the cloud. This in-turn unlocks a variety of use cases for analytics, reporting, and visualization for the enterprise.\nBecause of this end-to-end integration, data is secured all the way along the journey from the edge to the cloud, using multiple industry-leading authentication and transport security protocols. Once in the cloud the data is backed by AWS\xe2\x80\x99 comprehensive cloud security, tailored to the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAWS and Cisco customers are looking for ways to easily and securely connect devices to the cloud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael MacKenzie, General Manager, IoT Connectivity and Control, AWS. \xe2\x80\x9cCisco has developed a simple end-to-end solution to collect data from the industrial edge and move it to AWS IoT Core at scale. Instead of spending time on custom integrations, Cisco Edge Intelligence with AWS IoT Core allows customers to move faster and focus on innovating in their core business.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe invite our customers to learn more.

96,Welcome to the IoT Industry Roundtable on Closing the Digital Divide in Education,Vikas Butaney,"b'Welcome to the 3rd in our series of IoT Roundtables \xe2\x80\x93 this time focusing on how IoT is helping schools alleviate disparities in virtual learning. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all watched around the world as COVID-19 has put a spotlight on a challenge that has been around for a long time \xe2\x80\x93 a significant \xe2\x80\x9cDigital Divide\xe2\x80\x9d in education where many communities, families, and students don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to the Internet.\nA few dismaying facts:\nNationally, around 17% of children are unable to complete their homework due to limited internet access.\nHere, in California, about 1 in 6 school-aged children lack access to the internet at home.\nGlobally, UNICEF has estimated that 463 million children worldwide, or one of every three school-aged learners, do not have the tools they need to participate fully in virtual schooling.\nPrior to COVID-19, students from the disadvantaged communities had to rely on public libraries, fast-food restaurants, coffee shops, and WiFi enabled school buses to access internet and complete homework.\nHere at Cisco, we are committed to powering an inclusive future for all and connecting the unconnected so that students can learn \xe2\x80\x93 and teachers can teach \xe2\x80\x93 anywhere, anytime, and on any device. I\xe2\x80\x99ve invited Barbara Walker, Cisco Account Manager, and Andrea Azzoni, Cisco IoT Product Marketing Manager, to this Roundtable to explore how Cisco IoT is helping to close the Digital Divide and highlight how one school district in Texas is leading the way for their students.\n  VIKAS:  Andrea \xe2\x80\x93 Can you set the stage for our readers? Tell us about the challenges for school districts to close the Digital Divide.\nANDREA: At the heart of it, many households in at-risk communities have unreliable, low bandwidth connections or simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have an internet connection at all. Public carrier services might not be readily available or affordable in the at-risk communities, regardless of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s rural or urban. So, getting enough bandwidth for virtual school can be a challenge. Even spotty coverage can have a negative impact on student engagement and success. And often when there is connectivity available, there is the practical limitation of affordability for households that are now under more financial stress with COVID-19.\nTo deliver quality education content virtually, schools now have an added challenge in front of them \xe2\x80\x93 remote access.\nVIKAS:  Barbara \xe2\x80\x93 Does this ring true for the Canutillo Independent School District in TX where you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with them to close that divide?\nBARBARA: It sure does. The Canutillo Independent School District (ISD) in El Paso, Texas faced this same technology disparity that was preventing their students from continuing their learning remotely. The school district has 10 schools serving more than 6,000 students. Located near the Mexico-United States border, many students are first-generation Americans eager to learn so that they can be the first in their family to graduate from high school and college. But a high percentage of the households in their district lacked access to internet, creating a monumental challenge for distance learning.\nVIKAS: Barbara \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s when they called Cisco?\nBARBARA: Yes. In 2007 El Paso launched a community wireless project called Digital El Paso. The goal was to achieve digital inclusion, sustain economic development, and enhance government and public services. Based on this success, Canutillo ISD recognized Cisco as the company to help them address their digital divide. The district identified pockets of underserved, vulnerable populations to first focus on. They knew they needed to take quick action to ensure that students had access for remote learning. And they wanted to tap into funds available from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) federal funding.\nSo, they launched an innovative project called \xe2\x80\x9cCanutillo Connect.\xe2\x80\x9d This initiative extends a secure, private wireless network across the district to allow students free internet access from their home to conduct their remote learning, delivering:\nA pervasive Wi-Fi network that will serve the district\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerable populations, starting with a proof of concept\nCisco built-in security\nGreater bandwidth parity\nNetwork usage parameters, managed by the school\nFree access for all households\nThis project is a shining example of how Canutillo Connect is bridging the digital divide for the Canutillo community and leading the way for other school districts to emulate.\nVIKAS: Andrea \xe2\x80\x93 What does it take to close this Digital Divide? What\xe2\x80\x99s inside this wireless network?\nANDREA: It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful combination of Cisco Industrial Ethernet switches, Cisco Fluidmesh and Meraki. Let me break what we did down into three main steps:\nLeverage the existing fiber backbone: The local schools had a fiber network that we could tap into as the source for our connectivity. Laying new fiber was cost prohibitive, long term and not an option they could consider. So, we used Cisco Catalyst Industrial Ethernet Switches deployed at the light pole, which can withstand this Texas heat and also tap into the fiber network.\nCreate a wireless network: Then across the community, we leveraged existing public poles and towers to create a new WiFi backhaul network. With a network of Fluidmesh radios and Meraki Access Points, we created a WiFi Access Network.\nConnect anything: By repeating this process across the district, we extended the fiber backhaul across the district without the cost of laying new fiber. Now with dozens of these WiFi Access Networks across the at-risk communities, students have 24\xc3\x977 secure Internet access for any of their devices connect and learn on the school network.\n  VIKAS: Barbara \xe2\x80\x93 What\xe2\x80\x99s next for Canutillo Connect?\nBARBARA: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re currently rolling out the first phase of the project to the most impacted neighborhoods. Upon completion of this phase, the connectivity solution will be replicated across eight other areas to provide district-wide outreach to other vulnerable populations. This is a wonderful example of how Canutillo Connect is starting to bridge the digital divide for the Canutillo schools. And it\xe2\x80\x99s just the start of a larger digital transformation for their community.\nBased on lessons learned with Canutillo Connect, El Paso County has pulled together a broadband working group as a united response to the county wide broadband challenge. We are currently working on multiple digital divide grants including Project Overcome and Community Connect.  Canutillo Connect is being used as a model that will be replicated as a validated design for these grants.  This replication minimizes risk and adds quick ramp up time.\nVIKAS: Andrea \xe2\x80\x93 Can you tell our customers about how they can get started on this journey?\nANDREA: We\xe2\x80\x99ve bundled up these solutions so that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for our customers to get started. This Digital Divide solution is a great way for schools to quickly address their connectivity challenges and take advantage of COVID-19 related funds.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also part of a larger blueprint \xe2\x80\x93 the Connected Community Infrastructure (CCI) validated design \xe2\x80\x93 that offers a solution that has been fully tested and validated to support a broad range of city, community and roadways use cases. Based on a single, modular network with wired (fiber, Ethernet), wireless (Wi-Fi, cellular, V2X) and IoT communications (LoRaWAN, Wi-SUN Mesh) connectivity options, the solution greatly simplifies outdoor network deployment, management and security, thus lowering operating costs with cyber-security designed in.\n    Thanks to Barbara and Andrea for bringing us up to speed on this amazing customer story. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great story of how people and technology are moving quickly to respond to the unprecedented challenges of the last year.\nThe reality is that Internet access is woven into the fabric of the education. Connectivity is critical no matter if students are in the physical, hybrid, or virtual classroom \xe2\x80\x93 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s to complete homework, conduct independent research, collaborate with classmates, and go through the entire college application and admissions process. Parents need access to interact with teachers and stay involved in the educational process. Educators need access to connect to their classes and engage with students.\nAll of us here at Cisco IoT and Cisco Education look forward to working with school districts and communities across the globe as they work to close their Digital Divide.\nFind out more:\nContinue this conversation with this team at AskIoT@Cisco.com.\nRead more about how other Cisco customers, like the City of Toronto, are closing the digital divide.\nRegister for our webinar on February 23 \xe2\x80\x93 Bring Internet Access to Students Who Need It Most \xe2\x80\x93 Bridge the Digital Divide.\n  Share'",Tags: #Education #EducationNow Cisco Education Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul digital divide digital learning distance learning Smart Cities Virtual Classroom,"February 11, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
97,Five ways IoT is transforming rail operations,Bryan Tantzen,"b'Facing continued competition from rideshare apps and the dramatic shifts we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing around public transit in the last year, rail operators are looking for new ways to attract riders for safer journeys and keep costs down. Here are five ways we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing operators gain an edge by using the Internet of Things (IoT) \xe2\x80\x94 connecting onboard devices like IP security cameras and location transmitters to trackside networks.\n#1 \xe2\x80\x93 An onboard experience like being in your office or living room\nBack when passenger Wi-Fi was a novelty, riders would tolerate and accept dropped connections in tunnels and the countryside, and limited video streaming capabilities to name a couple examples. No longer. To attract riders who want to work or entertain themselves onboard, operators need fast, reliable Wi-Fi. The same investment can generate new revenue streams from infotainment services. For example, St. Petersburg Metro attracts riders with passenger Wi-Fi built on a Cisco Fluidmesh train-to-ground network with LTE backup.\n#2 \xe2\x80\x93 Better passenger safety, with real-time security video\nTraditional CCTV systems come up short for passenger safety because of poor quality and interruptions when trains move between wireless coverage zones. High-speed trackside networks and advanced wireless communications change the game. In Lyon, France, security personnel for SYTRAL (Syndicat mixte des transport pour le Rh\xc3\xb4ne et l\xe2\x80\x99agglom\xc3\xa9ration Lyonnaise) monitor feeds from more than 1000 IP cameras, at any train speed, with Cisco Fluidmesh train-to-ground technology. If any component fails, the network fails over to a backup in just a few milliseconds.\n#3 \xe2\x80\x93 Station crowd management with Meraki cameras\nIn the new world where social distancing and physical safety are more crucial than ever, technology that supports crowd management at train stations is key. With the help of Meraki cameras and its enhanced object detection analytics, rail operators can monitor people density, movement and social distancing right at the train station.\n#4 \xe2\x80\x93 Capture train location\nIf they can\xe2\x80\x99t reliably capture train position, operators have to maintain long \xe2\x80\x9cheadway\xe2\x80\x9d between trains. Now rail operators like one leading rail signaling vendor in Europe can capture train location. As a result, the vendor operates more cost-effectively than traditional metro systems while maintaining a safe passenger capacity.\n#5 \xe2\x80\x93 Predictive maintenance\nCisco train-to-ground infrastructure also supports predictive maintenance, for improved safety and lower costs. Onboard sensors transmit real-time telemetry information to the operations center, where machine learning models predict failures before they occur. Beyond onboard sensors, trackside infrastructure is critical to track as well. Remote condition monitoring of trackside infrastructure devices like signaling system, level crossing, and point systems have a direct impact on reducing operational costs for rail operators. For example, every minute a train is delayed on the track can potentially result in $1000s in fines. So rail operators need a much more efficient way to identify the trackside issues, and respond quickly to those.\nFor more on how Cisco is helping our customers improve rail operations, check out our new connected rail solution brief.\nShare'",Tags: #Security analytics Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul crowd management Internet of Things (IoT) meraki Meraki cameras on-board experience onboard sensors predictive maintenance rail rail operations train networks trains Wi-Fi,"February 10, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/320-150x150.jpg
98,Welcome to the IoT Industry Roundtable on IoT and the Circular Economy,Vikas Butaney,"b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are committed to moving from a linear economy, where products are used and then thrown away, to a circular economy that makes better use of our limited natural resources.\xe2\x80\x9d Cisco\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen amazing stories from our Cisco IoT (Internet of Things) customers of how they are leveraging IoT technologies to create a more sustainable future \xe2\x80\x93 from sensors that extend product life through IoT-enabled utility grids for renewable resource management and more.\nEqually important is our own commitment to move beyond the take-make-waste model. With thousands of customers across critical industries like utilities, manufacturing, and transportation deploying tens of thousands of devices, we\xe2\x80\x99ve amassed a huge IoT footprint. And the reality with Industrial IoT is that these devices will have a long lifespan of 10-15+ years. \nToday I\xe2\x80\x99ve invited participants from across Cisco to explore how we are making more sustainable choices and the impact to our customers.\nVikas: Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a look at how our IoT products are helping one industry in particular move the needle towards a more sustainable future.\nAGOSTINO: We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing remarkable progress in the utility sector with their use of our IoT technologies. As the world leverages more renewable energy sources like solar and wind, the utility industry faces new challenges. Those renewable energy sources aren\xe2\x80\x99t as predictable as other sources of power \xe2\x80\x93 requiring them to proactively manage their grids to deliver the reliability we all expect. In some countries, like Italy, utilities face steep fines for every second that the grid is down.\nBy using our Cisco IoT products to digitize their grid, they can increase efficiencies across their entire network, leverage more renewable energy sources, and deliver those high levels of reliability. And once you digitize the grid, you can start gaining additional benefits, like using smart meters as sensors as part of conservation voltage reduction (CVR) schemes. These meters are essential in helping the utilities company get real-time energy consumption data to balance the grid. But, utility companies can also build services on top of that data to help customers understand more about their energy usage, like when to curtail energy usage to lower their utility bills or when it\xe2\x80\x99s the ideal time to sell their green solar power back to the grid.\nI think that 2021 is going to be a remarkable year for IoT and sustainability. Just this past summer here in Europe, we saw the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest green stimulus package, with an earmark of US$572B for climate action. IoT is at the heart of the new green, sustainable energy economy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what Cisco and our customers can build together.\nVikas: Can you give us some insight into the products our customers are using \xe2\x80\x93 like the utility providers Agostino mentioned? How are we building circular design thinking into IoT products digitization? \nSRIPRIYA: Futureproofing the design of our new IoT routers was one of the most important considerations \xe2\x80\x93 particularly given that long lifespan our customers need. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to address our customers\xe2\x80\x99 current business challenges, while also giving them easy ways to leverage new innovations without having to completely replace their installed products. \nAn excellent example is 5G (and whatever comes next! ) We know that our IoT customers need multiple connectivity solutions depending on their use cases. For example, we intentionally designed our new Cisco 1100 Series Industrial Integrated Services Router (Cisco IR1101) in a modular fashion. Customers can swap in LTE or 5G modules when the pricing and use case make the most sense for them, without having to replace the device. In fact, our new Cisco IR1101 offers an impressive 140 unique combinations. \nWith forward-thinking circular design, we enable our customers to easily and cost-effectively take advantage of innovation. They save the expense of buying completely new equipment every time their requirements change, which also eliminates the resources and energy required to create new equipment across manufacturing, shipping, and logistics. By upgrading or repairing just the individual modules, customers extend the product\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, reduce materials that are disposed of prematurely, and help conserve resources, like metals and paint.  \nVikas: Sripriya \xe2\x80\x93 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also been working with our teams across Cisco to lower the environmental impact of our products through their design. You had some impactful results.\nSRIPRIYA: Let me highlight two primary areas:\nPOWER CONSUMPTION: When we design our products, we put a lot of thought and planning into power consumption. As IoT devices are broadly deployed with long lifecycles, the energy usage really adds up quickly. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say that our new Cisco IR1101 has reduced the idle energy consumption by 45% from the previous generation and 35% when running on full load. Considering the product sales and deployment over a 5-year period, that translates into 10,800 MWh of energy savings or 5,280 metric tons of CO2 emissions reduction.\nENVIRONMENTAL RUGGEDNESS: Our thinking here is Design Once, Use Anywhere. These devices have low energy usage, don\xe2\x80\x99t need cooling or heating, can work from -40\xc2\xb0C to 75\xc2\xb0C, and have many layers of hazardous location safety requirements built-in.\nYou can see that we\xe2\x80\x99ve really extended the utility and lifetime of the products for our customers. Not only does that help them keep their management costs down, but it also helps them accelerate their own innovative use of our products.\n    Vikas: Adam \xe2\x80\x93 Beyond the product itself, how are we helping our customers be more sustainable. Talk to me about packaging.\nADAM: We\xe2\x80\x99re doing amazing work on the design of our IoT products, with a very deliberate focus on prioritizing circular design principles. Within Cisco Supply Chain organization, we are also addressing what goes around the product \xe2\x80\x93 namely sustainable packaging. There are two significant wins we achieved on the Cisco IR1101 router that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention.\nFOAM ELIMINATION: Use of sustainable and recyclable materials is an industry-wide priority. The rich product robustness that Sripriya described enabled us to migrate from packaging which would historically incorporate foam inserts for cushioning to an all-corrugated design. This is better for the environment, and much easier for our customers to deal with when they are installing our products.\nPACKAGING DENSITY: Imagine receiving 3,000 boxes of individual routers \xe2\x80\x93 like in the case of a recent Cisco IoT Smart Roadways client. (And that was just the first order). Not only is all that packaging wasteful, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also time-consuming to simply break the packaging down for recycling. To support deployments with this level of scale, we\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a 10-pack unit with accessories now bundled in the same box. That\xe2\x80\x99s a much better experience for our customers, and it also has a ripple effect across the supply chain. Streamlined packaging means more units fit onto a pallet which translates into lower shipping costs, more efficient staging and less energy usage.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re excited to continue to push the envelope on circular design principles and have some rather audacious goals in this area.\nLooking ahead\nThank you Sripriya, Adam, and Agostino for giving some insights into Cisco IoT and the many ways we are powering a more sustainable, circular economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s impressive to see how our utility customers are using our solutions to seamlessly integrate renewable energy into their grids. And how we here at Cisco are taking our Circular Economy goals to heart by building more energy-efficient and modular products, as well as cutting down on the packaging and waste for our customers.\nTo read more about Cisco and our circular economy goals, click here.\nTo learn more about our line of Industrial IoT products, click here.\n          Share'",Tags: circular economy digitization Energy energy efficiency green stimulus package Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing Mining Oil and Gas Renewable Energy Sustainability Utilities,"February 4, 2021",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

101,Industrial IoT: Top 3 trends for 2021,Patty Medberry,"b'After 2020\xe2\x80\x99s twists and turns, here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that 2021 ushers in a restored sense of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d In thinking about what the upcoming year might bring for industrial IoT, three key trends emerge.\nTrend #1: Securing operational technology (OT)\nIT will take a bolder posture to secure OT environments.\nCyber risks in industrial environments will continue to grow causing IT to take bolder steps to secure the OT network in 2021. The CISO and IT teams have accountability for cybersecurity across the enterprise. But often they do not have visibility into the OT network. Many OT networks use traditional measures like air gapping or an industrial demilitarized zone to protect against attacks. But these solutions are rife with backdoors. For example, third-party technicians and other vendors often have remote access to update systems, machines and devices. With increasing pressure from board members and government regulators to manage IoT/OT security risks, and to protect the business itself, the CISO and IT will need to do more.\nSuccess requires OT\xe2\x80\x99s help. IT cybersecurity practices that work in the enterprise are not always appropriate for industrial environments. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, IT doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the expertise or insight into operational and process control technology. A simple patch could bring down production (and revenues).\nBottom line? Organizations will need solutions that strengthen cybersecurity while meeting IT and OT needs. For IT, that means visibility and control across their own environment to the OT network. For OT, it means security solutions that allow them respond to anomalies while keeping production humming.\nTrend #2: Remote and autonomous operations\nThe need for operational resiliency will accelerate the deployment of remote and autonomous operations \xe2\x80\x93 driving a new class of networking.\nThe impact of changes brought on in 2020 is driving organizations to increasingly use IoT technologies for operational resiliency. After all, IoT helps keep a business up and running when people cannot be on the ground. It also helps improve safety and efficiencies by preventing unnecessary site visits and reducing employee movement throughout facilities.\nIn 2021, we will see more deployments aimed at sophisticated remote operations. These will go well beyond remote monitoring. They will include autonomous operational controls for select parts of a process and will be remotely enabled for other parts. Also, deployments will increasingly move toward full autonomy, eliminating the need for humans to be present locally or remotely. And more and more, AI will used for dynamic optimization and self-healing, in use cases such as:\nautonomous guided vehicles for picking and packing, material handling, and autonomous container applications across manufacturing, warehouses and ports\nincreased automation of the distribution grid\nautonomous haul trucks for mining applications\nComputer-based train control for rail and mass transit\nAll these use cases require data instantly and in mass, demanding a network that can support that data plus deliver the speed required for analysis. This new class of industrial networking must provide the ability to handle more network bandwidth, offer zero latency data and support edge compute. It also needs security and scale to adapt quickly, ensuring the business is up and running \xe2\x80\x93 no matter what.\nTrend #3: Managing multiple access technologies\nOrganizations will operate multiple-access technologies to achieve operational agility and flexibility.\nWhile Ethernet has always been the foundation for connectivity in industrial IoT spaces, that connectivity is quickly expanding to wireless. Wireless helps reduce the pain of physical cabling and provides the flexibility and agility to upgrade, deploy and reconfigure the network with less operational downtime. Newer wireless technologies like Wi-Fi 6 and 5G also power use cases not possible in the past (or possible only with wired connectivity).\nAs organizations expand their IoT deployments, the need to manage multiple access technologies will grow. Successful deployments will require the right connectivity for the use case, otherwise, costs, complexity and security risks increase. With wireless choices including Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN, Wi-SUN, public or private cellular, Bluetooth and more, organizations will need to determine the best technology for each use case.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation: Build an access strategy to optimize costs and resources while ensuring security. Interactions between access technologies should deliver a secured and automated end-to-end IP infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 and must avoid a \xe2\x80\x9cmishmash\xe2\x80\x9d leading to complexity and failed objectives.\nAs the end of 2020 fast approaches, I wish everyone a safe and healthy New Year. As you continue building and refining your plans for 2021, please consider how you can unleash these IoT network trends to reduce your cybersecurity risks and increase your operational resiliency.\n  Share'",Tags: 2021 trends 5G autonomous vehicles business resiliency Cisco IoT CISO Cybersecurity distribution grid Featured IIoT Industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Things (IoT) Internet-of-Things LoRaWAN Manufacturing mass transit Mining Oil and Gas Operational Technology (OT) Remote Access Transportation Utilities Wi-Sun WiFi 6,"December 16, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg
102,Why I Practice Digital Hope,Dave Wilson,"b'The idea that technology can and should make the world a better place has been said so often that it can come off as a clich\xc3\xa9. As tech professionals we intend to make a difference, but serious action often gets sidetracked by day-to-day distractions.\nManifesting hope is about making our intentions a priority. It\xe2\x80\x99s about having the courage to take serious action and hold ourselves accountable, just as we do for our business. Combining hope with technology and passion to make a difference for everyone is what I call \xe2\x80\x98Digital Hope.\xe2\x80\x99\nLike many, I truly believe we have a responsibility to not only help customers transform their businesses, but also to transform our healthcare systems, build safer communities, and help foster a worldwide digital neighborhood.\nThe creativity and innovation that can be unlocked by digitization opens up the art of the possible. And it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for all of us, both as individuals and as representatives of the technology industry, to make Digital Hope a reality.\nHow I try to give back\nI am as unlikely an IT guy as you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever meet. As a young man in New Zealand I began working as a builder\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice after my father died.  A few years later I had just finished building my Mum a house and was in-between jobs. So, she enrolled me in a computer course at the local community college. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Mum, why did you do that? I\xe2\x80\x99m a builder.\xe2\x80\x99 At the time I knew less than nothing about computers or the Internet.  The closest thing I had access to was a Commodore 64 gaming system. I remember taking notes in class: \xe2\x80\x98This is a mouse and this is a keyboard.\xe2\x80\x99 But this impulse on my Mum\xe2\x80\x99s part ultimately changed my life.\nI realized early on that employment in the digital world opened doors and gave me choices I would never otherwise have had, and that many of my mates from high school didn\xe2\x80\x99t have. It gave me Digital Hope. As I worked my way up the ranks professionally, I looked for ways to use my knowledge and resources to give something back. I focused on the areas I am most passionate about. One of those areas is mental health and well being.\nPeople tend to think of New Zealand as a chill place, but it has one of the highest rate of youth suicide in the OECD. In part that\xe2\x80\x99s because of isolation and living in remote areas where mental health resources are scarce, but also because of the pressures our kids are feeling in today\xe2\x80\x99s high-performance society. It\xe2\x80\x99s especially critical in minority communities, where people already feel like outsiders and there\xe2\x80\x99s a cultural stigma associated with talking about things like this.\nSo we got involved with Youthline, an organization that offers crisis support to troubled Kiwi youth. Cisco donated more than $1 million worth of Webex video meetings, and had one of our channel partners deploy it for free across New Zealand, so counselors could talk face-to-face with kids about the things they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell any of the adults in their lives.\nBut these problems are not just limited to New Zealand. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m also an investor in Mentemia, a start-up focused on the global problems of anxiety and stress. Mentemia\xe2\x80\x99s ten-year goal is to improve 100 million lives and save 100,000 souls by combining advanced AI with deep knowledge of mental health.\nHow can you get involved?\nMy purpose in writing about these things is not to demonstrate what a great person I am. It\xe2\x80\x99s to share that we all have skills and resources we can contribute to address issues we\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about. I want to put some urgency behind using technological advancements to help solve some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wicked problems.\nThere are three things we all can do to raise our hands, take action, and become part of the solution:\n* Find a problem you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about. If nothing comes immediately to mind, Singularity University has taken the UN\xe2\x80\x99s global development goals and identified a dozen global grand challenges, from energy and the environment to food and shelter, that could desperately use your help.\n* Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to do it on your own. Join others in your community who are already working the problem. Ask them how to get started. Involve your peers, partners, investors, customers, and the leadership of your company.\n* Take action now. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait until your calendar clears up or for a new fiscal year\xe2\x80\x99s budget. These problems aren\xe2\x80\x99t waiting, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t either.\nThe technology community is rich with the kind of expertise, experience, intellectual property, relationships, and funding most not-for-profits can only dream of. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to put all of these resources to work so we can \xe2\x80\x93 yes \xe2\x80\x93 make the world a better place. For all of us.\nDave Wilson is vice president of global IoT sales for Cisco.

103,Welcome to the IoT Industry Roundtable for Connected Intersections and Roadways!,Vikas Butaney,"b'I think one of the most amazing things about Cisco IoT is that every day we get to see how our customers are using our solutions to transform their industries, increase their business resiliency, and improve safety for their assets, workers, and citizens.\nToday we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look with that lens on the public safety and transportation sector. I\xe2\x80\x99ve invited members of the Cisco IoT team to share their insights and expertise:\n  I also invite you to keep the conversation going by commenting on this blog, connecting with me on LinkedIn, or sharing your thoughts at AskIoT@Cisco.com.\n  Let\xe2\x80\x99s set the stage here for our audience. Arik \xe2\x80\x93 Can you give us a little insight into the motivations to make intersections and roadways smarter?\n      When we look at trends in the public sector, we are seeing a lot of growth in connected intersections, corridors and communities. Primarily, that growth can be traced back to four primary trends:\n  Cities continue to grow, with 1B+ cars on the road increasing traffic congestion by 25% over the past five years\nBy 2030, 20% of cars will have V2X (Vehicle to Everything) technologies to provide the benefits of real-time vehicle data and communications\nEnvironmental and sustainability concerns are driving the need to improve public and multi-modal transportation services using connected technologies\nWe are now also seeing larger scale implementations at state and country levels, as well as city and county levels, driven by these new use cases as well as infrastructure modernization and security needs\nBut, at the heart of it, there\xe2\x80\x99s really one overriding reason why everyone wants roadways to get smarter \xe2\x80\x93 to save lives. The World Health Organization estimates that every 23 seconds, a road user in the world dies from a traffic incident \xe2\x80\x93 whether a car user, pedestrian, or cyclist. Plus, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got worker safety zones where there\xe2\x80\x99s a high incident of injury and death.\nSocial and demographic trends demand we find ways to have more cars and transportation capacity \xe2\x80\x93 while also making it safer for travelers, workers, and citizens to ultimately get to our goal of zero traffic related deaths.\n  Continuing with that thought Arik. What are the challenges and opportunities for technology to help with that goal?\n      To start with, there is a lot of old technology out there, like traffic cabinets and signal controllers, and a lot of ground to cover \xe2\x80\x93 literally. In the US alone, we have over 300K intersections and an estimated 220K critical miles with significant technology and connectivity challenges.\nCompound that with emerging technologies like V2X that we spoke of earlier. Given the recent FCC decision and the clarification on standards for V2X spectrum use, we expect that the US will now accelerate in its the adoption and deployment of V2X technology. But that acceleration also requires attention on one critical issue \xe2\x80\x93 security.\nAs intersections and roadways are digitized, we are significantly expanding the threat landscape across interconnected systems and those V2X vehicles. Consequently, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing heightened interest and investments in security as critical parts of these smarter roadways and intersections projects.\nIn fact, these types of outdoor connectivity are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to their limited physical security. That risk needs to be balanced by extra strong cyber-security. Unfortunately, even today with limited connectivity there have been too many examples of ransomware and denial-of-service attacks on city and transportation infrastructures, demonstrating that better and stronger cyber-security measures are urgently needed!\nWith all these challenges comes immense opportunities. By digitizing \xe2\x80\x93 we can really start to make the road smarter and safer. With technology woven into intersections and roadways, you can:\nGet data insights to manage traffic and increase safety\nConnect remote safety zones\nHandle the large volumes of data from connected vehicles and sensors\nDetect exactly where and when problems occur so that problems get fixed faster\nAll of this and more puts us on an aggressive path to that goal of zero-traffic related deaths.\n  I know you spend most of your days helping our clients roll-out solutions Sripriya. Can you tell us more about what you are seeing?\n      We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing so much activity across the board \xe2\x80\x93 but particularly related to Arik\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the importance of getting data insights to increase safety.\nOur department of transportation and municipal customers are rapidly connecting their traffic controllers and adding new real-time sensors. They want to have more dynamic control of how they control the traffic by being informed of details like where and when pedestrians are crossing, where are the cyclists, what are the types of traffic \xe2\x80\x93 truck vs car, what are the weather conditions, and more.\nReal-time accurate data and connectivity on roadways and intersections from cameras, counters, weather systems and other sensors, enables our customers to provide dynamic message signs, manage traffic flows dynamically, automate tolling systems, and improve traffic congestion and road safety.\nThe key for all of this is that reliable, secure connectivity for road sensors, traffic controllers, cameras, connected to the traffic management center so operators can adapt to the dynamic conditions, inform the drivers and increase safety on the roads.\n  Speaking of traffic management, I remember a conversation I had with you about unconnected traffic lights. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s common to wonder why traffic lights don\xe2\x80\x99t better adjust to traffic?\n      Yes Vikas! Many of us have been frustrated at an empty intersection at midnight, wondering why the lights do not adjust? Many of those 300K intersections are unconnected traffic lights that are on loops where they have the same timings every day \xe2\x80\x93 regardless of time, traffic conditions, or weather. It often takes years before any configuration updates are made because they rely on manual surveys to track traffic patterns. When those loop systems fail and the lights go down, there is no automatic fault notification. Authorities must wait for someone to notify them that lights are down.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that cities don\xe2\x80\x99t want smarter traffic signals. But they are burdened with outdated technology. Most of these intersections are using legacy technologies. If they are using traffic cameras and CCTV, they are usually on different networks which is expensive and often lacks adequate cyber-security. Traditionally, it has been difficult, costly, and risky to digitize.\nDeploying Layer 2 unmanaged switches is easy, but leaves the door open for a cyber-security disaster.\nDeploying traditional managed switches and maintaining per switch ACLs is an unmanageable nightmare.\nSo, it\xe2\x80\x99s often a Catch-22 scenario. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Cisco steps in with our modern network and security management solutions to make networks BOTH easy to deploy and highly secure.\n  Clearly connectivity is at the heart of all these solutions. Arik \xe2\x80\x93 help us understand what options these organizations have?\n      Customers essentially have three basic options for the connectivity \xe2\x80\x93 fiber, cellular, and wireless backhaul. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with fiber. Fiber offers great throughput and performance, and if a customer has fiber already in place, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very cost-effective solution. With Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s ruggedized Industrial Ethernet switches, you can light up that fiber network and extend ethernet connectivity, including POE, out from the roadside cabinet, all with automation and security.\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing one of our customers do just that like the City of Schenectady, New York. Schenectady  sought to leverage and extend their fiber network and bring zero-trust secure, connectivity to their more than 200 roadside cabinet ethernet switches that need to securely connect their traffic controllers, cameras and WiFi APs.\nBy making their traffic controllers smarter, they could reduce the number of hours responding to issues and deliver a better, safer driver experience for their residents.\n    I know that in addition to fiber, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of old copper out there \xe2\x80\x93 particularly for our European customers. Tarannum \xe2\x80\x93 can you tell us options for our customers to leverage that infrastructure?\n      When we talk about choice for our customers, now we can offer them one more choice for their wired cabinets \xe2\x80\x93 Copper + DSL. With legacy PSTN lines being discontinued by service providers in Europe, UK, and Australia, customers can leverage existing copper by plugging in DSL lines directly into industrial routers using the xDSL module.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re making it easy for customers to leverage this capability. With a single global module for all DSL technologies, our customers don\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about the specific DSL capability in any location. This dramatically simplifies their operations. Plus, the modular IR1101 router design allows them to add new capabilities on the same base networking infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 maximizing their ROI and futureproofing their investment.\nFor example, our DSL module is being deployed by a large Department of Transportation in the UK. They are mounting the Cisco IR1101 industrial router in roadside cabinets and use DSL as the primary connectivity to manage traffic lights at roadside intersections. With reliable and secure connectivity, they will be able to simplify traffic flow remotely.\n  Sripriya \xe2\x80\x93 what about customers that don\xe2\x80\x99t have fiber or copper which is often the reality? Laying down new fiber is expensive and digging trenches is not a quick process. Can they use cellular? \n      When there\xe2\x80\x99s no existing connectivity into those cabinets, cellular is a wonderful option. Our line of cellular-capable industrial routers deliver secure connectivity anywhere it\xe2\x80\x99s needed plus simplified management tools. Plus, customers can add dual LTE connections for increased resiliency.\nLet me tell you how we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing customers like Statewide Departments of Transportation using these technologies. As Arik mentioned above, roadways can be very dangerous places \xe2\x80\x93 but they also present amazing opportunities to collect information to make them safer. With roadside sensors and connectivity, we can collect real-time information on weather conditions like floods, wet roads, and fog to alert drivers in advance. Anytime you are driving on a highway and you see those large driver information signs \xe2\x80\x93 they are powered by IoT.\nAnother great use case is emergency vehicle traffic prioritization. By adding real-time, secure connectivity to traffic signal controllers, you can create favorable traffic patterns for emergency response vehicles. Here we also leverage AT&T FirstNet LTE connectivity to use the location information from the vehicles and communicate with the traffic controllers to create a fast, priority route for the response vehicle.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s really important to these customers is to make these connectivity solutions simple, secure, and\nscalable. They potentially have thousands of roadside cabinets with traffic controllers. They need to be able to securely connect them in harsh outdoor environments while remotely operating and managing them.\nNow that they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the benefits and ease-of-deployment for this real-time connectivity, they are looking to extend it broadly to create safe, reliable and integrated transportation systems. Think beyond intersections and roadways into every transportation modality \xe2\x80\x93 connected mass transit, metro, rail, maritime, aviation, freight and logistics.\n  What about when they want to stream high bandwidth? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that get expensive with cellular? What are you seeing Stan?\n      Absolutely it does. The appetite to stream video from every intersection is strong and growing. So many of the applications our customers look to deploy require predictable performance \xe2\x80\x93 high bandwidth, low latency, often both \xe2\x80\x93 and predictable cost. Cellular networks can be capacity constrained, generally don\xe2\x80\x99t support high bandwidth streaming up from the edge and come with significant recurring costs if they do.\nWith Cisco Fluidmesh, we provide a solution to deploy private wireless solutions with the performance of wired connections and the flexibility of nothing buried in the streets.\nFor another great example, look at the Virginia Department of Transportation (VA DOT). They have thousands of intersections with traffic signals; some were connected to a network. Most were not. Of the ones that were, the physical infrastructure needed to be refreshed, but the cost of trenching, the new fiber, and the associated downtime was significant. Using Cisco Fluidmesh, they were able to very quickly, in a matter of days and weeks, deploy point-to-point and point-to-multipoint wireless connectivity to take the place of the broken fiber and copper connections, bring new intersections onto the network much more quickly, and enabling over-the-top video streaming wherever they needed it.\nNow, VA DOT is making driving safer for residents \xe2\x80\x93 adjusting more quickly to temporary road closures and realizing hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital and operational savings.\n  Tell me more about other things our customers are doing with Cisco Fluidmesh. What business problems are we solving for?\n      Think simple, secure, and scalable connectivity. With Cisco Fluidmesh, you can connect your assets and quickly deploy networks where wiring is hard. Cisco Fluidmesh has a specialty in providing ultra-low latency, ultra-reliable, and high throughput connections to stationary things like poles in a city, nomadic things like roadside message signs, and fast-moving things like fleet vehicles and trains.\nOne of our customers in France \xe2\x80\x93 the Lyon Metro System \xe2\x80\x93 wanted to ensure the public was safe anywhere on their journey. They invested in a Cisco network to support system-wide video surveillance in all their train stations. But the passengers\xe2\x80\x99 expectations don\xe2\x80\x99t stop at the yellow line on the platform; riders need to know that using the system is safe, turnstile to turnstile. To give riders the same confidence while on their driverless, autonomous trains, they extended that same connectivity and surveillance capability to the moving trains. With Cisco Fluidmesh in place, they now have more than 1000 high-definition public safety and emergency cameras streaming from 100+ trains, providing real-time views from all trains as they circulate.\nThis type of wireless capability solves the connectivity challenge in many demanding settings \xe2\x80\x93 like on-the-go and remote use cases. Another of those key use cases is rapidly bringing high quality internet access to disadvantaged areas to help close the Digital Divide, and I look forward to sharing more about that in our next IoT Roundtable.\n  Thanks Stan for the plug for our next IoT Roundtable! But first \xe2\x80\xa6 Arik \xe2\x80\x93 These secure connectivity options to start making roadways, intersections, and transit smarter all sounds great. But, how do we help customers speed to a solution?\n    We\xe2\x80\x99ve got so many resources for customers to explore as they get started on their path. In this blog, we\xe2\x80\x99ve placed links to case studies and products to explore. I encourage readers to reach out to any of us with questions where we can share what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and learned by rolling out these solutions over the last decade.\nTo help accelerate our customer\xe2\x80\x99s journey, we also have a very concerted and significant effort to produce industry blueprints. These Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs) reduce implementation and operational risks by validating and documenting the Cisco best-practice designs and blueprints for specific solutions.

104,Which industrial wireless technology is right for you? Answer 8 questions to find out,Henry Teichert,"b'If wireless networking were a middle-school cafeteria, the cool kids would be hanging together at tables called Wi-Fi 6 or 5G. The latest generation of wireless technologies offers much faster download and upload speeds. It slashes latency. In short, it goes well beyond what the current generation can do, either in terms of a single stream of data from a device, or more important in industrial IoT networks to implement higher density of devices and reliability mechanisms.\nGiven all that, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder so many industrial IoT customers come to us asking: How do we make Wi-Fi 6 and/or 5G work in our environment?\nWe share the excitement around 5G, as well as the potential of Wi-Fi 6. Yet we also know that when it comes to supporting industrial IoT, the best question to ask is this: What is the right combination of wireless technologies to meet our connectivity needs? That question may not seem as \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d as going straight to the latest technologies, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to start building a multi-access strategy, enabling IP traffic to securely flow end to end.\nWithout a multi-access strategy, you could end up building a wireless connectivity infrastructure with a mishmash of vendors that drives up cost, complexity and security risks. By starting with a big-picture assessment, you can craft and execute a strategy unique to your business and your industrial IoT goals. And, yes, you can work with a vendor that is technology agnostic to bring it all to life in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s coordinated, efficient, secure, and future ready.\nWhere to start\nAs you begin exploring your access and backhaul options, consider your needs in these categories: Use Case, Spectrum, Distance and Total Cost of Ownership.\nUse Case\nConsider which use case(s) you need to support and what each of those requires. Does connectivity need to be fully private, or can it leverage public services? Will the coverage be indoor or outdoor, fixed or mobile? Do you need to enable it for backhaul or access capabilities?\nAnd what are your power parameters \xe2\x80\x93 will devices be plugged in or do they need to run on battery? These are a few questions that can help to quickly identify a potential technology candidate.\nSpectrum\nThink through your spectrum needs. Where will the solution be implemented, and what are the regulations for that country? Does the solution necessitate any specific requirement that can not be met with unlicensed spectrum? Does it require paying for private spectrum, or is it acceptable to leverage a mobile carrier\xe2\x80\x99s spectrum and services?\nTechnology Differentiation\nThe throughput and distance that your connectivity infrastructure must support will dictate your requirements in several key areas: transmit power, signal penetration, bandwidth capacity and long/medium/short range communications. Remember that all the use cases call for end-to-end IP (v4/v6) traffic to smoothly flow through the infrastructure. Is there an impact of asymmetrical upstream/downstream bandwidth capacity?\nTotal Cost of Ownership\nAssess the costs of potential solutions for each use case. Keep in mind the full range of costs, including device/infrastructure, ease of operations, and subscriptions/OpEx vs. Buy once/ CapEx. Think, too, about backward compatibility; you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to implement a new solution that then requires a rip-and-replace of existing investments.\nCisco can help you think through these questions with the Industrial Wireless Technology Advisor. Answer a maximum of eight questions to identify your options and then develop a connectivity access strategy that meets your technical needs without undue cost, complexity, or security risk. At the end of the day, that\xe2\x80\x99s really cool.\nShare'",Tags: #Security 5G Cisco Industrial WiFi Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul IIoT infrastructure Internet of Things (IoT) Mining multi-access Oil and Gas spectrum Utilities Wi-Fi 6 wireless,"November 18, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1555415377-bpfull.jpg
105,Ports: A Complex Environment Transforming with Automation,Vikas Butaney,"b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re like me and my family, you get pretty excited when that package arrives at the door. But, for most of those packages and their contents, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long, crowded journey.\nThe global shipping industry itself is huge \xe2\x80\x93 $8.7B in 2019 and projected to grow to $12B+ by 2026. And that number doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include the goods they ship. Amazon alone sold $164 billion worth of items on its website this year. By volume, 90% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s trade goods are transported by sea. There are around 53,000 ships in the world\xe2\x80\x99s merchant fleet, 5,000 of which are container ships, and the largest of those carries more than 20,000 containers. In the US alone, there are there are approximately 360 public and private-owned commercial sea, lake and river ports that maintain the shore-side facilities for the transfer of cargo between ships, barges, trucks and railroads. You get the picture.\nAll those goods transported by sea make their way to a port where they take the next step on their journey. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of complexity behind that process. Have you ever thought about what happens when those huge ships come into port?\nTo start with, cargo terminals are very complex and dangerous environments. Huge container ships come to port with thousands of containers loaded with goods that need to get unloaded. Cranes unload and load immense container ships. Those containers are moved into stacks via a variety of vehicles that get loaded onto trucks and trains. These \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-model\xe2\x80\x9d ports handle every possible type of transport except an airplane.\n  Being able to coordinate all of that is a huge challenge \xe2\x80\x93 both in scale and complexity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge that is ideal for automation.\nThe Path to Digital\nThe largest area that ports are digitizing is their Terminal Operating Systems (TOS). TOS systems track all assets at the port, regardless of who is the owner. Because at ports, many different parties are involved. One firm owns and operates the physical port \xe2\x80\x93 the port authority. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the shipping firm, the transport firm, etc. Coordinating across those entities with paper tickets is incredibly time consuming and layered with errors.\nWith a good TOS in place, the port authority can know what each crane or truck is doing, what ship is coming in, and if a train is arriving with goods. And they can use automated dispatch and timed unloading/loading to deliver operational efficiency across the board.\nMoving to Remote Operations\nOnce you know what the assets are, where they are, and how they are moving, you can move people out of harms\xe2\x80\x99 way with remote operations to improve efficiency and safety. Yard vehicles operate in these outdoor environments with horrible weather and dangerous working conditions where each year lives are lost. The faster the containers move safely off and on ships out of the stacks, the greater the operational efficiency and overall profits for all companies involved.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take at the complexity of those huge cranes. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen the movies with chase scenes where action heroes are in a gun fight running amongst the containers. But in the real world, the real dangers are the equipment \xe2\x80\x93 like the ship-to-shore cranes that move up and down the berth to get those containers off the huge cargo ships.\nThose cranes are 10-15 stories tall. Just pause to think about how tall that is. American football field goal posts are 35 feet tall \xe2\x80\x93 so those cranes are 3-4 goal posts tall! Even more surprising perhaps is that a crane operator must climb stairs to the top of that crane. Up at the start of the shift. Down when they need to take a break. And then back up again. When they are in the operations room, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got dozens of cameras to help guide them in unloading and loading the vessels. Outside of the obvious dangers, they also experience high levels of fatigue from this environment.\nBut, if you can add remote operations to this scenario and put the operator on the ground, you\xe2\x80\x99ve changed everything. The operator is in a safe environment. They can take breaks. They don\xe2\x80\x99t waste time climbing up and down dangerous stairs. Remote operations not only deliver efficiencies, but in harsh settings like ports \xe2\x80\x93 it saves lives.\nThere are significant hurdles for those remote operations to be successful. Think of all the obstacles in that port. Those stacks of containers are like metal buildings that are often six containers high with as many side by side. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a metal city which translates into a horrible environment for connectivity. Remote operations require dozens of high-resolution video feeds and that needs a high bandwidth network. Traditional RF and cellular struggle to handle the strength and reliability. That\xe2\x80\x99s why super strength wireless and highly reliable networks are the underpinnings of all remote operations.\nDelivering Round-the-Clock Ports with Autonomous Operations\nMoving to autonomous operations transforms ports across many different vectors. With autonomous operations, 24\xc3\x977 ports can become a reality \xe2\x80\x93 enabling the entire shipping ecosystem to operate at higher levels of efficiency and be able to handle the inevitable constant changes that come from weather, production changes, or even public health crises.\nAutomation also helps increase safety across the boards \xe2\x80\x93 from the massive Rubber Tired Gantry (RTG) crane systems and rail-mounted gantry (RMG) cranes through auto shuttle carriers and automated guided vehicles (AGV). Every time automation gets added to the process, the safety of workers is improved.\nIn addition to safety and efficiency, automation translates into increased profitability. Ports and terminal want to accept bigger and bigger ships. The more autonomous the operations, the bigger the ship they can bring in safely \xe2\x80\x93 from both an employee and physical plant perspective.\nWhen those large ships come to dock, they throw huge tie lines to short. Tides, waves, and wind take their toll on the ship that then bashes into and pulls on the physical infrastructure. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for jetty walls to disintegrate into the ocean.\nAutomation changes the entire equation. Sensors on the ocean walls can provide insights as to which ship is causing what kind of damage. This results in benefits for autonomous vessels that control positioning thrusters, keeping a safe and consistent distance from the wall. It\xe2\x80\x99s a win-win situation where port operators get more profits from larger ships and can lower the cost for autonomous ships to dock.\nAutomation in Action\nHow are companies like Cisco solving for these complexities? Those huge cranes we spoke about earlier are essential to ports and historically very challenging to automate. Much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s RTG fleet is diesel-powered with limited options for automating RTGs given the fact that running cables to them is costly and often unpractical.\nTo solve this challenge, Cisco Fluidmesh partnered with Konecranes to solve the connectivity challenge and deliver a world-first 100% wireless Automated Rubber Tired Gantry (ARTG) crane system. Now container terminal operators can roll out remote control and automation to RTGs in the container yard without running fiber or cable spools, with substantial savings in cost and time.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s wireless MPLS-based technology has been proven in many vehicle automation systems around the world where 802.11 Wi-Fi or LTE haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to deliver. The focus on seamless roaming, extremely low latency, and high throughput wireless networks delivers the reliability and security that operators need to trust these critical systems to automation.\nTake for example one of our customers \xe2\x80\x93 the Port of Malta. Malta Freeport is a premier trans-shipment hub, having successfully operated for over 30 years as a vital part of the Mediterranean containerization market. Knowing the value of automation for safety and efficiency, a remarkable evolution is taking place at Malta Freeport Terminals. Cisco Fluidmesh wireless connectivity is being used to seamlessly integrate all present and future movable assets, such as Quayside cranes, RTGs and yard equipment, to create a zero-packet loss, low-latency roaming wireless backbone.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOriginally, we intended to use the Fluidmesh system only on the Quayside cranes. However, we later discovered that it also offers great potential on our RTGs fleet as well,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Malta Freeport Terminals Head of IT Jesmond Baldacchino. \xe2\x80\x9cIt complements our IoT and big data projects currently being undertaken. With this system, we are also in a position to gain full wireless coverage in areas which were previously challenging.\xe2\x80\x9d  Watch the full story here.\nThe Foundation for Autonomous Operations? A Secure and Reliable Network\nThe secret power behind autonomous operations? Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s secure and reliable network for IoT that powers the entire system and connects everything \xe2\x80\x93 device to vehicle to data to Cloud \xe2\x80\x93 making sure your autonomous operations have the right data to make the right decision at the right time. Autonomous operations rely on that perishable data at the edge that is only valuable at that moment.\nLikewise, autonomous operations are only successful if the entire system is secure. If the network were to be hacked, perpetrators could take over the autonomous operations. Imagine the crane dropping the cargo. Or the AGV being rerouted to follow the wrong path causing an accident. You have to trust your network to trust your business to autonomous operations.\nGet Started Today on Your Path to Automation\nLearn more about how Cisco can connect any asset, anywhere with Industrial Asset Vision and our suite of industrial IoT products.\nExplore Fluidmesh for on-the-move assets for connectivity and reliable backhaul.\nSee how we are discovering and securing devices with Cyber Vision.\nDive into our Cisco Connected Rail Validated Design \xe2\x80\x93 a blueprint of foundational technologies for port optimization and data on the move in difficult RF environments like ports.\nShare'",Tags: #Security automation autonomous operations cargo terminals Cisco IoT Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Ports containers cranes Internet of Things (IoT) remote operations shipping terminal operating systems,"October 29, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
106,Building Your IoT/OT Security Project: Where to Start?,Vikram Sharma,"b'As industrial organizations connect more devices, enable more remote access, and build new applications, the airgap approach to protecting industrial networks against cyber threats is no longer sufficient. As industries are becoming more digital, cyberattacks are getting more sophisticated, and yet many organizations are lagging in the adoption of updated and reliable industrial cybersecurity postures. And when these organization\xe2\x80\x99s security leaders start building a strategy to secure operations beyond the industrial demilitarized zone (IDMZ), they realize it might not be as simple as they thought.\nIndustrial assets (as well as industrial networks, in many cases) are managed by the operations team, which is typically focused on production integrity, continuity, and physical safety, rather than cyber safety. The IT teams often have the required cybersecurity skills and experience but generally lack the operations context and the knowledge of the industrial processes that are required to take security measures without disrupting production.\nBuilding a secure industrial network requires strong collaboration between IT and operations teams. Only together can they appreciate what needs to be protected and how best to protect it. Only together can they implement security best practices to build secure industrial operations.\nEnhancing the security of industrial networks will not happen overnight: IT and operations teams have to build their relationship; new security tools might have to be deployed; networks might need to be upgraded and segmented; new correlation policies will have to be developed.\nSecurity is a journey. Only a phased and pragmatic approach can lay the ground for a converged IT/OT security architecture. Each phase must be an opportunity to build the foundation for the next. This will ensure your industrial security project addresses crucial security needs at minimal costs. It will also help you raise skills and maturity levels throughout the organization to gain wide acceptance and ensure effective collaboration.\nBeing the leader in both the cybersecurity and industrial networking markets, we looked at the successful projects Cisco has been involved in. This led us to recommend a three-step journey outlined in Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Security Validated Design.\nWhat is a Cisco Validated Design (CVD)? CVDs provide the foundation for systems design based on common use cases or current engineering system priorities. They incorporate a broad set of technologies, features, and applications to address customer needs. Each one has been comprehensively tested and documented by Cisco engineers to ensure faster, more reliable, and fully predictable deployment.\nOur approach to industrial security is focused on crucial needs, while creating a framework for IT and operations to build an effective and collaborative workflow. It enables protection against the most common devastating cybersecurity threats, at optimized cost. And provides a practical approach to simplify adoption.\nTo learn more, read our solution brief or watch the replay of the webinar I just presented. A detailed design and implementation guide will be available soon for helping to accelerate proof-of-concepts and deployment efforts.\nWant to get the latest news in IoT security?

107,Cisco Design-In Program: Accelerating Digital Transformation,Vikas Butaney,"b'Happy 1st Birthday to our IoT Design-In Program!  \nLast year at Partner Summit, Cisco IoT launched our Design-in Program with the goal of dramatically reducing our partners\xe2\x80\x99 new solution development efforts and accelerating the time to value for business results. Over this last year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had dozens of partners \xe2\x80\x93 Industrial Control System (ICS) vendors, Machine Builders, Building Automation System vendors, Smart Instrumentation vendors, and Rail Integrators \xe2\x80\x93 join the program. \nWith our documented best practices and implementation roadmaps, these Design-In partners are using Cisco networking products, embedded boards, security, and edge software to digitize their products and services quickly, without compromising on security.  \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at a few ways our partners have accelerated their digital transformation journey with the Cisco Design-In Program. \nCreating smart, connected, and secure business \nWith 135 years of technology expertise, Johnson Controls is a global leader in creating intelligent, secure, safe and connected buildings. They turned to Cisco to accelerate their journey to smarter buildings by reliably connecting Building Management Systems (BMS), video surveillance, Fire, HVAC systems to enhance occupants\xe2\x80\x99 comfort, safety and productivity.\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson Controls has a long history of working with Cisco. Cisco IoT networking products (Industrial Ethernet) power portions of the Johnson Controls next generation Metasys platform,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Jason Christman VP, Chief Product Security Officer Johnson Controls.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, we are expanding our collaboration with security offerings where Cisco Cyber Vision will enable us to offer differentiated cybersecurity services and network assessments to protect and prepare our customers for the next generation of building technologies \xe2\x80\x93 delivered jointly with Cisco plus accelerated with global sales enablement programs and close go-to-market collaboration.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBuilding a connected experience \nCustomers turn to Ventev \xe2\x80\x93 an engineering services firm \xe2\x80\x93 for turnkey Wi-Fi solutions, including infrastructure, software, and services. Ventev has been working with Cisco to simplify integrations, reduce risk, and accelerate their time to deployment for their solutions. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are thrilled to join the Cisco IoT Design-In Program and to partner with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s engineering and sales teams to develop collaborative solutions and cultivating joint go-to-market opportunities to meet our customers\xe2\x80\x99 IoT needs,\xe2\x80\x9d added Thad Lowe, General Manager of Ventev. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s new Industrial Ethernet 3300 Series switches, we can offer more robust IoT solutions for video surveillance, power distribution automation, and asset management for our buyers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDelivering an exceptional customer experience \nTo retain customers, every business is focused on delivering world class customer experiences. This is particularly true for rail operators looking to improve the rider experience. With the growing competition from ride-shares, a Design-In partner used Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT portfolio, including Fluidmesh, to power on-board Wi-Fi networks in St. Petersburg and Moscow. We also have Service Provider partners, like BAI Communications, leveraging the Design-In Program to grow their transportation business.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cAt BAI Communications, we deliver high quality communications infrastructure to large-scale transportation, transit and integrated rail systems around the globe. We Design-In many Cisco and Fluidmesh products, ranging from industrial networking, to security, and the data center,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ian Gallagher, VP Smart Transit and Infrastructure. \xe2\x80\x9cWe rely on Cisco components to operate at large scale for both stationary and mobile locations. Cisco is a valued partner both for the capability and reliability of the products, and even more so because of the knowledge and experience of the people behind the products.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGetting started with the Design-In Program \nMost businesses I talk to are looking to digitize their offerings. They are looking for new ways to leverage data generated to deliver new outcomes for their customers \xe2\x80\x93 like achieving higher uptimes with remote monitoring/predictive maintenance or capturing new revenue streams via a Machine as-a-Service model. \nWe know that in today\xe2\x80\x99s macroeconomic environment, you need to move fast with simple, secure, and scalable solutions. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re accelerating the partner journey with these three key capabilities.  \n1) Step-by-step guidelines and support to speed the creation new assessment and monitoring services \nWe know that connecting to edge services with a secure and reliable network is the foundation of all successful digital transformation initiatives. Many projects are initiated with no assessment of the end-customer\xe2\x80\x99s network capabilities or its security readiness. Design-In partners are then challenged to deliver on the promised outcomes, or worse, unintentionally expose customers to cyber-attacks and security risks. \nCisco enables our partners to develop assessment and monitoring service offerings with Design-In Cisco technologies with step-by-step network and security implementation roadmaps. \n2) A broad product portfolio to deliver intelligent IoT edge services\nDigital transformation projects require accurate data from the IoT Edge. Higher volumes of data at that edge, however, increase the threat landscape. And extracting the data from its source, transforming it so it is usable, and securely deliver the right data to the right applications to put it to work is a complex task. \nCisco offers Edge Intelligence orchestration software to simplify the edge to multi-cloud data flow, enabling edge analytics like asset monitoring or predictive maintenance. Partners can enable this software capability on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT network and benefit from flexible licensing options \xe2\x80\x93 opening the door for new revenue streams. Additionally, Cisco Cyber Vision provides device and traffic visibility to deliver cyber security at the IoT Edge.\n3) Industry-tested and validated solutions to help ensure success\nIn the new era of IT and OT convergence, industrial automation solutions are complex. Success requires multiple vendor products and close collaboration of all stakeholders to transform ideas into end-to-end innovative solutions. Customers have invested for decades in their infrastructures and need to have 100% confidence before adopting new solutions. \nCisco delivers experience and credibility to you and your customers \xe2\x80\x93 helping you accelerate your customer\xe2\x80\x99s journey. Cisco is the global IT and IoT leader \xe2\x80\x93 trusted by IT and Security buyers. We work collaboratively with our Design-In partners to navigate complexities and help design repeatable, scalable, and profitable solutions. Cisco remains fully committed to the long-term success of our partners, including well-defined and field-proven joint-GTM programs, sales enablement initiatives, and validation of all products in our Design-In solutions.\nNext up?\nAs they say, we\xe2\x80\x99re only just getting started.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been exciting to see how IoT technologies are key enablers to meet the challenges in front of us, like the new macro-economic conditions, global energy transitions, and dramatically changed work environments,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Nick Holden, Vice President of the Global Strategic Partner Organization, Cisco. \xe2\x80\x9cCompanies are increasingly turning to digitization and automation and our partners are in ideal position to accelerate those efforts. The Cisco Design-In Program tightly combines the unequaled business value brought by our industry partners with the broad, trusted portfolio of Cisco IoT secure connectivity solutions to help customers thrive.\xe2\x80\x9d \nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more Nick. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re gearing up to triple the size of our Design-In Program this year! \nWe\xe2\x80\x99re introducing a \xe2\x80\x9cDesign-In: Get in the Know\xe2\x80\x9d webinar series in January 2021 where you can hear first-hand from partners about their journey and ask our team members questions directly. Email design-in-webinar@cisco.com to pre-register for our first session.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got an entire team of technical, industry and product experts dedicated to drive partner success that are with you from Day One \xe2\x80\x93 from validating designs through joint go-to-market programs.\nCheck out one of our partner success stories with Sandvik.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to get started today, visit CiscoDevNet for reference guides and learning labs.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t miss out on the #IoTOpportunity.

108,IoT is Creating Massive Growth Opportunities,Dave Wilson,"b'At Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been strong believers in the Internet of Things. Today we\xe2\x80\x99re in the age of a digital transformation where billions of connected devices are communicating with each other, the edge, and the cloud. Industrial automation is pervasive across factories and farms, manufacturing, facilities and mines. Connected devices are monitoring our energy grid and ensuring the safety of emergency responders.\nIoT is changing how businesses operate and driving an IT OT convergence. But creating secure networks of autonomous machines is not something anyone should take for granted. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to simply connect everything; you also need to intelligently manage all those devices. You need a way to measure and optimize your operating costs to avoid unplanned expenses and downtime, to diagnose problems and optimize network performance, to secure data in transit and prevent devices from being compromised, to scale your operations. And you need tools that help you take the vast amounts of data these devices generate and put it to use.\nNo one company can do all of this all alone. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so pleased to announce that Cisco IoT has extended our partnership with AT&T to manage IoT devices for enterprises.\nCisco + AT&T: A deep connection\nFor more than a dozen years, Cisco and AT&T have worked together to provide connectivity to our industrial customers. Using the Cisco IoT Control Center platform, AT&T offers their enterprise customers visibility into more than 70 million IoT devices across virtually every sector of the economy \xe2\x80\x93 including manufacturing, automotive, utilities, transportation, and the public sector.\nIn 2013, for example, a well-known car manufacturer deployed Cisco IoT Control Center to manage connectivity for its fleet of connected vehicles, which today generate upwards of 2.3 TB of data an hour. Control Center gave the manufacturer the tools to deploy and scale vehicle rollouts, manage cost of operations, and monetize services within the vehicle.\nControl Center proved so useful that the car maker collaborated with Cisco on a proof-of-concept project, deploying our industrial OT cyber security solution, called  Cyber Vision on their factory floor. Cyber Vision is embedded in our industrial networking providing full visibility into their Industrial Control System operations, including dynamic asset inventory, real-time monitoring of control networks and process data, and comprehensive threat intelligence to control risk.\nThe manufacturer is now looking at deploying Cyber Vision alongside Cisco Industrial Ethernet 2000 and 3000 Series Switches throughout its production facilities.\nWhile car manufacturers are quickly adopting IoT, an example of how Cisco and AT&T are working together to solve real-world problems is through the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet).\nA public-private partnership between the U.S. federal government and AT&T, FirstNet is a dedicated wireless broadband network that connects thousands of emergency responders across the nation. Work is already underway to bring connected devices such as government building management systems, roadways, and traffic intersections onto AT&T\xe2\x80\x99s FirstNet network, using FirstNet Ready\xe2\x84\xa2 Cisco 1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged (IR1101).\nEvery day, Cisco and AT&T are working together to help save lives by improving the speed and efficiency of emergency response.\nIoT will impact every industry\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve barely scratched the surface. By 2030, the number of connected devices in the world will be somewhere between 25 billion and 125 billion.\nNo matter which estimate you believe, that\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of IoT. The number of potential use cases we are addressing is virtually unlimited. Here are a few examples:\nEnergy. Millions of smart meters help utility companies to identify outages and enable their customers to consume less power. But utilities can also use a combination of industrial switches, gateways, private LTE/5G IoT to automate their substations, allowing them to lower costs and improve customer service.\nTransportation. By taking advantage of wireless network communications technologies, container terminals can be operated remotely, lowering costs while boosting safety. IoT can also help shippers track cargo, navigate more efficiently, and reduce losses from damaged goods, saving them billions of dollars.\nManufacturing. IoT is the heart of Industry 4.0 and Digital Factories. I have seen connected devices on the factory floor cut production cycles by well over 20%, and reduce defects and downtime by half in some of our customers.\nMining. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s connected mining solutions have already been installed in thousands of locations worldwide, allowing mine operators to boost equipment reliability, reduce maintenance costs, respond more quickly to emergencies, and increase employee safety.\nSmart cities. Municipalities are using connected devices to reduce pollution, cut costs, and deliver better services to citizens. In dozens of cities around the world, sensors embedded in traffic lights and roadways work to regulate the flow of cars, while automated lighting systems have been shown to reduce energy bills and crime.\nSecurity and safety. Thousands of office buildings, airports, roadways, and other facilities are protected by Cisco connected safety and security products, which includes IP cameras, industrial gateways, and cellular connections, as well as the software to manage them.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just a small sample of how connected devices are transforming virtually every industry. This change is happening in real time. All enterprises need to start thinking about how IoT can accelerate their digitization initiatives and drive business outcomes.\nLearn more about the Cisco and AT&T partnership in our press release.\nDisclaimer: FirstNet\xc2\xae and FirstNet\xc2\xae Ready are registered trademarks and service marks of the First Responder Network Authority.\n  Share'",Tags: AT&T Control Center data devices Energy FirstNet Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing Mining public sector security Smart Cities Transportation Utilities,"October 23, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2020/10/Daves-Headshot-150x150.png
109,Mining: An Essential Industry Transforming with Automation,Vikas Butaney,"b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the path to automation inside\xe2\x80\xafan industry that has a particularly\xe2\x80\xaflong\xe2\x80\xaflist of challenges \xe2\x80\x93 like the\xe2\x80\xaf$680B\xe2\x80\xafmining industry. Like many industries,\xe2\x80\xafmining is facing a\xe2\x80\xafsevere worker shortage, driven particularly by the dangerous, difficult,\xe2\x80\xafand remote work conditions. For mining, we\xe2\x80\x99re\xe2\x80\xaftypically talking severe weather conditions \xe2\x80\x93 like\xe2\x80\xafin\xe2\x80\xafthe middle of Australia with months of extreme heat. And where workers leave\xe2\x80\xafhome\xe2\x80\xaffor weeks or months at a time \xe2\x80\x93 living in barracks away from their families.\xe2\x80\xaf \nTo\xe2\x80\xafhelp\xe2\x80\xafsolve these problems, the mining industry is turning\xe2\x80\xafautonomous vehicles and autonomous operations into\xe2\x80\xafa reality.\xe2\x80\xafAutonomous operations\xe2\x80\xafallow you to give those workers much better working conditions. It enables you to operate in those conditions 24\xc3\x977 to maximize investments. It puts less wear on equipment that costs millions of dollars\xe2\x80\xafeach. And new technologies attract new workers and\xe2\x80\xafa\xe2\x80\xafmore diverse pool to offset a workforce that is\xe2\x80\xafrapidly approaching\xe2\x80\xafretirement.\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x80\xaf \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xafdig\xe2\x80\xafinside the mining industry, see where\xe2\x80\xafthe move to autonomous operations is\xe2\x80\xafmaking life better while\xe2\x80\xafdelivering real business value, and how this applies to other industries, like distribution centers, oil and gas, and\xe2\x80\xafmanufacturing.\xe2\x80\xaf \nThe\xe2\x80\xafPath from\xe2\x80\xafAnalog to\xe2\x80\xafDigital to\xe2\x80\xafAutonomous\xe2\x80\xaf \nOften the first step into autonomous operations for mining\xe2\x80\xafis\xe2\x80\xafdigital dispatch\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x80\x93 where drivers are provided the correct route to travel from the mining site location to the dump. One of our customers installed an IoT\xe2\x80\xafwireless\xe2\x80\xafmesh infrastructure across their mine sites to deliver apps on their mobile fleet, as the remote location had no cellular or wireless capabilities.\xe2\x80\xafThey were able to achieve\xe2\x80\xafROI within 6 months simply from trucks not missing their routes.\xe2\x80\xafWith digital dispatch, the\xe2\x80\xafmine company\xe2\x80\xafcan\xe2\x80\xafdetermine the optimal path, provide that to the driver,\xe2\x80\xafand have insight into\xe2\x80\xafany departures from that path.\xe2\x80\xaf \nSafety and Speed with Remote Operations\xe2\x80\xaf \nRemote operation\xe2\x80\xaftakes the digital process one step closer to autonomy. Here one remote operator can drive four dozers off of the same joystick. Not only is it safer for the operator, it also saves considerable time and money.\xe2\x80\xafConsider all of the challenges with underground mining. To simply get workers\xe2\x80\xaffrom the barracks to the remote underground location, the transport busses can take an hour or more each way. And in hot mines, the workers need to exit their equipment and go into refuge chambers to cool down.\xe2\x80\xafNot only does that cost money, it puts workers in unsafe places. With\xe2\x80\xafremote operations\xe2\x80\xafpowered by industrial IoT access points and switches,\xe2\x80\xafnow\xe2\x80\xafit takes only a few minutes to get remote equipment in\xe2\x80\xafthat underground mine operating for the shift.\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x80\xaf \nDelivering\xe2\x80\xafAccuracy, Efficiency, and Safety with Autonomous Operations\xe2\x80\xaf \nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at how autonomous operations\xe2\x80\xafis transforming\xe2\x80\xafopen pit mining\xe2\x80\xafand haul trucks.\xe2\x80\xafTo understand the scale of these operations, consider that these haul trucks can carry a payload of nearly 400 tons and are as long as 3 full-size pick-up trucks. In autonomous operations, the\xe2\x80\xaftruck drives itself using GPS coordinates\xe2\x80\xafto \xe2\x80\x9cauto-arrive\xe2\x80\x9d at the shovel. The shovel then drops the ore it picked up into the haulage truck. And then the haulage truck goes to dump or crusher.\xe2\x80\xaf \nThe more fine-tuned this process can be through\xe2\x80\xafautonomous\xe2\x80\xafoperations;\xe2\x80\xafthe more revenue can be extracted. In this process, the dirt that has no ore value \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9coverburden\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 simply needs to get to the dump. Conversely, the dirt with value goes to the crusher. If the manual dispatch system makes a mistake, then you are literally dumping your profits. Now,\xe2\x80\xafwith autonomous operations, you minimize or even eliminate\xe2\x80\xafthe\xe2\x80\xafchances of\xe2\x80\xafa\xe2\x80\xafmissed route.\xe2\x80\xaf \nBeyond the efficiencies, both autonomous and remote operations solve significant safety issues.\xe2\x80\xafThese large vehicles have enormous blind spots \xe2\x80\x93 where they can run over that full-size pick-up truck sometimes without even knowing. Having visibility and control over the locations and actions of vehicles and other equipment\xe2\x80\xafis\xe2\x80\xaflifesaving.\xe2\x80\xaf \nTo power\xe2\x80\xafautonomous operations,\xe2\x80\xafnumerous access technologies are available from low frequency offering long range and low bandwidth to microwave for higher data rate needs. 5G\xe2\x80\xafoffers the promise\xe2\x80\xafof low latency and high reliability\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x80\x93 but the\xe2\x80\xafreality today is Wifi 6 and options like Cisco Fluidmesh.\xe2\x80\xafThat\xe2\x80\x99s where you can have the reliability and power to make decisions at the edge and also back haul data \xe2\x80\x93 like video surveillance. \nUsing Cisco Fluidmesh, you can do Point to Point (PtP) for high throughput needs from the main datacenter building to towers around the mine. This sets a strong foundation to leverage Point to Multipoint (PtMP) from the towers to the trailers in the open pit areas \xe2\x80\x93 extending bandwidth for video, slope stability radar, dewater pumps, etc. These trailers can support Cisco Fluidmesh end points installed on the mobile fleet for autonomous operations \xe2\x80\x93 plus they can also support WiFi access point for the access layer. \nLeveraging both Cisco Fluidmesh and WiFi can allow for generic end devices like tablets, phones, and clients for sensors. LoRaWAN\xe2\x80\xafdelivers the connectivity needed for all of the battery-powered sensors connections,\xe2\x80\xafwhile\xe2\x80\xafLIDAR powers the GPS tracking. Each access layer has its own job to do\xe2\x80\xafto deliver the secure, reliable network\xe2\x80\xafneeded\xe2\x80\xaffor autonomous operations.\xe2\x80\xaf \nCustomer Story: Fort Wingate\xe2\x80\xaf \nTake, for example the challenges with automated operations in a highly dangerous setting \xe2\x80\x93 excavating for explosives. Here, our customer, Fort Wingate in New Mexico has to do everything remotely. Imagine piloting a drone \xe2\x80\x93 but instead you are remotely operating heavy excavator equipment in a real minefield. Every decision those operators make is reliant on high resolution video that provides real-time situational awareness.  \nInside the Operations \nFort Wingate needed to clear the ordnance from large areas using three dozers and three excavators. Because of the inherent dangers in disturbing active ordnance, they needed a remote system allowing operators to drive equipment remotely from a safe distance. The system allowed for up to three pieces of heavy equipment to be operated simultaneously, what is known in the industry as having \xe2\x80\x9cthree chairs.\xe2\x80\x9d \n  The Challenge \nRemote operations are a challenging application from a wireless communication standpoint. It requires low time latency, seamless roaming, and substantial upload speed for the live video streaming from each excavator with direct communication always required. \nGiven the size of the area and the limited infrastructure available, wireless coverage had to be pervasive. Furthermore, the material removed and other vehicles operating in the area can create line-of-sight challenges, an issue which typically causes dropped signals. Any signal degradation, even for \xc2\xbd a second, typically halts the remote operation.\xe2\x80\xaf\xe2\x80\xaf \nThe Results\xe2\x80\xaf \nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xafFluidmesh\xe2\x80\xafdelivered a low-latency wireless network to support the mission-critical real-time video feed. By adopting an MPLS-based protocol, the Fluidmesh\xe2\x80\xafsolution was able to exceed the network requirements and guarantee a 0-millsecond handoff time and less than 10 milliseconds of latency to all land clearing vehicles. \nIn order to extend reliability even further, the\xe2\x80\xafFluidmesh\xe2\x80\xafWireless MPLS network also supports Vehicle-to-Vehicle mesh networking, thus allowing trucks to mesh together in case there is no clear signal back to an access point. \nNext up \xe2\x80\x93 The Complex World of Ports \nJoin us for the last in our blog Transforming Industries with Automation where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on port automation. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it to be both interesting and informative to learn more about how ports are automating and how that might apply to your industry.  \nIn the meantime, learn more about how\xe2\x80\xafCisco\xe2\x80\xafcan connect any asset, anywhere with our suite of industrial IoT products and our new on-the-go solutions, how we are discovering and securing devices with Cyber Vision, and how our intent-based networking is delivering the simplicity and automation\xe2\x80\xafneeded\xe2\x80\xaffor IoT at scale.\nMissed the first blog in the series?

110,Simple. Secure. Scalable: Introducing Cisco’s new asset and facility monitoring solution,Vikas Butaney,"b'The impact of today\xe2\x80\x99s world is driving organizations to turn to IoT not just for efficiencies, but also for resiliency. To adapt and thrive, organizations need data for visibility into their operations in ways they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t perhaps imagined. Across IT and OT, businesses are now challenged to monitor assets and facilities when no one or few people are physically on the ground and in places where employee safety may be at risk.\nWith smart sensors and monitoring applications, organizations can:\nImprove employee safety and efficiencies by limiting unnecessary site visits, equipment checks and reducing employee movement throughout facilities;\nReduce expenses by identifying and avoiding premature equipment failure;\nImprove customer satisfaction by reducing unplanned outages and corresponding operational downtime.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why Cisco is excited to announce two new simple-to-deploy sensor solutions to give you the visibility and data you need across your business \xe2\x80\x93 from IT network closets to OT and Line of Business environments and everything in between.\nMeraki\xe2\x80\xafMT Sensors \xe2\x80\x93 ideal for Meraki network users to monitor indoor IT facilities like network closets\nCisco\xe2\x80\xafIndustrial Asset Vision \xe2\x80\x93 a new IoT solution that integrates together new Cisco sensors, an Cisco IoT gateway and a new cloud-based dashboard\xe2\x80\xafto monitor OT assets and facilities in outdoor and industrial indoor spaces\nAccelerating critical projects with simplicity\nSensors deliver the measurement granularity needed to make the right decisions to improve operations and resiliency. Data like the temperature, humidity, and facility ingress/egress activity, water leaks or the location of assets can impact safety of products, location or an entire business.\nCustomers have been connecting sensors to our networks for years. But the struggle to get these solutions up and running at scale was daunting. These solutions lacked the integration with the network causing long deployment cycles, complexity at scale, and missed insights. There should be a better way.\nNow Cisco Industrial Asset Vision and Meraki MT answer these problems. They are all-in-one, pre-integrated, secure, cloud-managed solutions that include new Cisco sensors, our existing gateways, and a dashboard for operations and system management.\nFrom the sensors to the gateway, Industrial Asset Vision deploys in minutes using a mobile app with QR codes and is built to scale as your business grows. Both have cloud-based management reducing the burden on IT, integration costs across business locations. The operational dashboard provides a single view of the asset or facility health for all associated sensors, across related assets and facilities, and even down to the IoT gateway itself.\nWhether you\xe2\x80\x99re in an outdoor/industrial OT environment or a traditional IT environment, our two new solutions are simple, secure, and scalable. From the sensor at the network edge all the way to the cloud-hosted dashboard, Cisco has you covered.\nIndustrial Asset Vision in Action\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve already started seeing positive business outcomes for both our IT and OT customers. Take for example our Waste Management \xe2\x80\x93 a leader in garbage collection and disposal, recycling, and dumpster rental.\nCisco Industrial Asset Vision has helped them quickly and safely tackle key operational challenges. Waste Management has massive industrial yards with thousands of large dumpsters \xe2\x80\x93 making it very challenging to know the physical locations and repair status to accurately fulfill customer orders. Now with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Asset Vision and its geolocation sensor, Waste Management brings automation to their tracking and reporting capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 making their operations more efficient and safer while also raising their customer satisfaction.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespite their physical size, we have a lot of pieces of equipment that can be a challenge to keep track of. With Cisco Industrial Asset Vision, we can monitor exactly where our inventory is in our sites and fulfill customer orders faster and more accurately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vu Nguyen, Senior Manager for Corporate Development and Innovation, Waste Management. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of the all-in-one fully tested and secure solution is its simplicity. Our field engineers can install sensors and gateways in a matter of minutes and almost immediately share data in the cloud-based management dashboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTechnology delivering smarter and safer work environments\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that as the world continues to change, businesses need to be safer and more resilient. Cisco IoT and Meraki are delivering the agility and the intelligence to help organizations quickly adapt their businesses.\nClick here for more on Industrial Asset Vision for OT spaces and here for more on Meraki (MT) for IT spaces.\nTo learn more about Industrial Asset Vision and Meraki (MT), check out the on-demand replay of our digital event: Connect More, See More, Do More, Building Business Resiliency in Your IT and OT Environments.\n  Share'",Tags: Cold Storage compliance environmental Equipment Monitoring geolocation Internet of Things (IoT) LoRaWAN Mining Oil and Gas Operations technology OT QR Code Refrigeration Monitoring Remote Facility Monitoring telemetry Temperature transport Utilities Vibration visibility Warehouse Monitoring,"October 14, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
111,Resiliency and the Path to Automation,Vikas Butaney,"b'Look anywhere and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find conversations about autonomous\xe2\x80\xafoperations. Everyone is weighing in on how to balance the benefits from these new technologies with the perceived impact on society and our collective future, particularly in our\xe2\x80\xafCovid\xe2\x80\xafreality. What I can tell you \xe2\x80\x93 from an industrial IoT perspective \xe2\x80\x93 is that we are seeing autonomous operations having a very positive effect.\nAcross industries, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing autonomous operations deliver increased business resiliency, better jobs, improved working conditions, increased efficiency,\xe2\x80\xafand a higher quality of work/life balance\xe2\x80\xafacross many industries.\nAutonomous trains: Since the first driverless trains in the late \xe2\x80\x9890s, more and more passenger train lines are being built and converted to automated lines, delivering additional safety for passengers, operational flexibility and reduced operating costs. Driverless trains can increase throughput by increasing the frequency of trains on a metro line and at the same time, they deliver a track record for safety that human drivers are unable to match.\nWarehouses and distribution centers: Entirely autonomous loading systems are now taking and fulfilling orders from the supply chain. Forklifts and pickers fetch the product, deliver to the pallet, wrap for shipping, and transport to the shipping dock.\nO&G exploration:\xe2\x80\xafOnce workers get a drill rig close to the target drill area, the rig can take over by itself \xe2\x80\x93 saving workers from a job that not only is dangerous but can take days.\xe2\x80\xafThe autonomous drill can also quickly make on-the-fly changes, like adjusting the angle of the drill, to increase yield and efficiency.\nAuto manufacturing:\xe2\x80\xafHere manufacturers are weaving autonomous operations into their industrial automation efforts \xe2\x80\x93 like using RFID on to keep track of car bodies as they move across the production line and Automated Mobile Robots (AMRs) to safely move material across the factories.\nAmusement rides:\xe2\x80\xafToday the most advanced and desired rides in amusement parks are the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdark rides\xe2\x80\x9d, where visitors hop on fully autonomous vehicles speeding up through a completely dark warehouse and where the experience is provided though immersive displays, VR googles, and incredible accelerations. The entire outdoor \xe2\x80\x9camusement network\xe2\x80\x9d is connected by wireless access\xe2\x80\xafpoints on the vehicles and the infrastructure, all powered by rugged IoT switches and routers.\nBehind each level of automation is a communication and connectivity challenge across industries.  Autonomous operations require vast quantities of real-time video and data that legacy networks simply can\xe2\x80\x99t handle \xe2\x80\x93 and often the operations are in harsh, remote, and dangerous locations. Trains are constantly in motion across remote geographies and inside tunnels, presenting unique connectivity challenges. All this automation translates into the need for high bandwidth, high security, and high reliability.\nThe Foundation for Autonomous Operations \xe2\x80\x93 A Secure and Reliable Network\nThe secret power behind autonomous operations?\nIt starts with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s secure and reliable network\xe2\x80\xaffor IIoT that powers the entire system and connects everything \xe2\x80\x93 device to\xe2\x80\xafvehicle to data to\xe2\x80\xafCloud \xe2\x80\x93 making sure\xe2\x80\xafyour autonomous operations have the\xe2\x80\xafright\xe2\x80\xafdata to make the\xe2\x80\xafright\xe2\x80\xafdecision at the right\xe2\x80\xaftime. Autonomous operations rely on that perishable data at the edge that is only valuable at that moment. After an incident, it does little value to know the vehicle should have turned.\nLikewise, autonomous operations are only successful if the entire system is secure. If the network were to be hacked, perpetrators could take over the autonomous operations. Imagine the mining truck being rerouted to follow the wrong path causing an accident. You have to trust your network to trust your business to autonomous operations.\nThe recipe for your success?\nWe know that automation comes with challenges as we\xe2\x80\x99re right there alongside our customers in their environments. No other company has the breadth of experience inside IT/communications and industrial settings across voice,\xe2\x80\xafdata,\xe2\x80\xafand video to bring IT and\xe2\x80\xafoperations together.\nEvery day we work with our customers to accelerate their success by:\nBringing their IT/OT ecosystems together \xe2\x80\x93 so that IT can leverage all that they already know about Cisco networking and OT can get projects going quickly and securely\nBuilding a strong network of industrial partners who know the ins and outs of these industrial operations \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99re just getting started\nDelivering more validated designs, like our new Distribution Automation \xe2\x80\x93 jointly validated with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories \xe2\x80\x93 that highlights advantages from new innovations to the Cisco Resilient Mesh\nNext up \xe2\x80\x93 Take a Deep Dive into Autonomous Mining\nOver the next few blogs, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take you deeper into some automation use cases \xe2\x80\x93 first with mining and then with ports.

112,Announcing Cisco Embedded Wireless … Anywhere,Anthony Savaglio,"b'For today\xe2\x80\x99s everyday activities and work, wireless connectivity has shifted from a luxury to a necessity. More and more industries and public spaces require reliable, secure, and fast Wi-Fi for a growing list of use cases. The world\xe2\x80\x99s needs have evolved from a one-size-fits-all network to requiring tailor-made deployments or connectivity built directly into their assets. Now, Cisco is delivering an embedded access point that will provide industry-leading wireless technology wherever needed: the Cisco 6300 Series Embedded Services Access Point (ESW6300).\nThe ESW6300 is the first embedded access point from Cisco, purpose-built to fill a physical and digital gap in the Wi-Fi landscape. Designed without an enclosure but instead with industry-leading operating temperature range, this access point gives partners the ability to create custom, environment-specific enclosures, or build Wi-Fi directly into their products to serve their customers\xe2\x80\x99 unique needs. Early use cases include:\nSmart kiosk, light pole, and bus stop public Wi-Fi to bring the personal and business benefits of connectivity to public locations and retail in urban areas, malls, arenas, and public transport stations\nVehicle-mounted camera footage offload to enable first responders to automatically move their large collections of data from car to station without costly cellular networks or manual effort\nUrban mesh networks fitted into newspaper stands to allow Wi-Fi to navigate difficult city landscapes and require only power cabling to extend the network\nClass I, Division 1 hazardous location enclosures to take the ESW6300 to parts of refineries and chemical processing plants that traditional industrial APs can\xe2\x80\x99t go\nIoT networks have no limits with the ESW6300. Dual Power Over Ethernet (PoE) out ports reduce power cabling requirements for peripheral devices and sensors, and an SFP port enables fast and efficient network backhaul.\nWhat makes ESW6300 an exciting access point for Cisco is its versatility. Early use cases have been identified and tested by our partners, but limitless possibilities exist. Whether built directly into an automated guided vehicle or custom enclosed to connect something yet unheard of in an unprecedented environment, the Cisco 6300 Series Embedded Services Access Point is a fit.\nLearn more about ESW6300 here.\nShare'",Tags: access point Cisco Industrial WiFi Embedded Internet of Things (IoT) mesh networking Power over Ethernet Wi-Fi wireless,"September 30, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2020/09/Anthony-Orchard-3-150x150.jpg
113,The new direction of IoT,Bryan Tantzen,"b'Enterprises around the world are transforming their operations in response to the global pandemic. One new enterprise challenge and requirement coming out of 2020 is business resiliency. To address this need, enterprises are expanding the automation and digitization of the operational space via the Internet of Things (IoT).\nAt Cisco, we think of business resiliency as having two prongs: 1) the workforce and 2) the workplace. For the workforce, business resiliency means the ability to work remotely in a secure manner. For the workplace, it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of having a trusted work environment.\nBut we know business resiliency is about much more than maintaining operations during a global crisis. Business resiliency solutions for the operational space can deliver powerful new outcomes. In the operational space, business resiliency solutions lead to a safer work environment, increased output, reduced downtime, and new customer offerings.\nBusiness resiliency is driving the next wave of pervasive automation\nFor many enterprises, the journey to automation began a couple decades ago with a goal of improving productivity. Robots were used to automate individual processes, but material flow between automation systems was performed manually.\nToday, in an effort to reduce human exposure, business resiliency is driving automation to be more autonomous and connected. Enterprises with partially automated processes are extending that automation end to end so that devices are fully interconnected and function with little human interaction. Some enterprises are even moving to remote and autonomous automation, both of which eliminate the need for an operator to be physically at the line. Instead, operators can be hundreds of miles away at a safe location.\nAutomation is driving the next wave of digitization\nDigitization is also evolving, driven by automation. Enterprises have gone from digitizing back-office functions such as finance and HR, to digitizing the customer interaction, to accelerating business efficiencies, most recently with big data and cloud computing. Prior to organizational shifts brought on in 2020, enterprises were connecting IoT devices, and generating massive amounts of data to drive analytics at the cloud and edge. It was about connecting the virtual world and using analytics to drive predictive maintenance and replacing inefficiencies with automation using data. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a thin slice of data compared to the phase we\xe2\x80\x99re entering now.\nDriven by business resiliency and the need for agility and flexibility, digitization is expanding to connect the physical world. It\xe2\x80\x99s driving people to take the next step around fully connecting environments, automation, and moving people into new roles where they can be safer while maintaining production levels.\nWarning: new connectivity challenges ahead\nThese new levels of automation and digitization significantly change the technology requirements we see at the edge in IoT programs. To deliver on their business resiliency initiatives, enterprises need an infrastructure that supports:\nZero-latency data for real-time control of unmanned vehicles, to make decisions faster, and support for applications at high speed\nMore network bandwidth to accommodate pervasive video, automated guided vehicles, thermal imagery, and 3D sensors\nNew cyber security capabilities to protect an expanding threat surface\nSimplified scalability to deploy and manage more devices across more locations with the same resources\nEdge compute to process and act on data closer to the source, thereby reducing costs and maintaining compliance\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning. As enterprises extend networks everywhere, wireless growth is exploding. Not only is it extending to new areas, but organizations have an ever-growing list of connectivity technologies to choose from. A common mistake we see enterprises make is thinking that one wireless technology will work for every automation and IoT use case. Wireless technologies are key pillars of IoT, but one size does not fit all. Organizations need a cohesive access strategy to avoid increased cost, complexity, and security risk.\nWhen choosing an access technology, such as Wi-Fi 6, LoRaWAN, or 5G, organizations should consider:\nDevices \xe2\x80\x94 what devices need to connect?\nResiliency \xe2\x80\x94 what are the application requirements?\nDeployment \xe2\x80\x94 what are the deployment scenarios?\nTechnology \xe2\x80\x94 what are the potential technology options?\nTotal cost of ownership \xe2\x80\x94 what are the CapEx and OpEx implications of each technology option?\nHow Cisco can help\nAt the core of operational resiliency, Cisco is enabling the evolution of IoT. Only Cisco offers all types of access technologies to meet operational needs. We provide a complete solution for secure, policy-based, high-performance connectivity into the operational domain that will scale and accommodate multi-access technologies. This includes IoT industrial routers, IE switches and wireless, Cisco Cyber Vision for industrial security, and Cisco DNA Center for network infrastructure automation and policy.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about how to enable business resiliency through automation and digitization, watch my recorded webinar, The New Direction of IoT.\nShare'",Tags: automation business resiliency data digitization Internet of Things (IoT) LoRaWAN sensors Wi-Fi 6,"September 28, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/320-150x150.jpg

115,Increasing distribution grid reliability with FLISR enabled by Cisco IoT Network,Sean Song Jiang,"b'Electric utility companies are increasingly turning to Distribution Automation to help increase grid stability and reduce operations costs. With a broad variety of network choices available \xe2\x80\x94 public/private LTE, Wi-Sun 802.15.4 RF mesh \xe2\x80\x94 utilities are realizing the value of adopting multiple networking technologies to get the best cost structure for Distribution Automation (DA) communication. With the help of our Cisco Validated Design (CVD) for DA, power utilities can build a secure, scalable, easy-to-manage network infrastructure that extends all the way to the IoT edge.\nOur latest update to the CVD provides a validated solution and practical design guideline for deploying Cisco Resilience Mesh for Fault Location, Isolation, and Service Restoration (FLISR). Along with the capabilities provided in earlier Cisco DA CVDs, utilities are enabled to operate FLISR, Vol-VAR optimization, and SCADA applications over Cisco Resilient Mesh and LTE. In addition, a universal network management system with single pane-of-glass visibility helps reduce network operations overhead. The CVD provides utilities the flexibility to combine various network technologies that best fit their use cases and regions to build multi-service field area networks (FAN).\nBuilding a Distribution Automation architecture\nAs power utilities adopt distribution automation, they are looking to achieve several positive business outcomes. Power utilities benefit from increased profitability due to optimized voltage and a reduction in line loss and conservation voltage. DA also helps decrease service interruptions through improved asset monitoring, predictive maintenance, and security. The reduction in outages and outage duration help organizations meet regulatory requirements. Finally, distribution automation can increase reliability and efficiency of distributed energy resources.\nIn order to address the variety of DA use cases including FLISR, Volt-VAR optimization, equipment health monitoring, and distributed energy resource (DER) integration, power utilities must consider several key factors for networks in order to make the DA project successful, including:\nScalability\nResiliency\nSecurity\nManagement and automation\nEdge computing\nValidated solutions\nFLISR integrated with Cisco Resilient Mesh in the DA Cisco Validated Design\nThe new release of the Cisco Validated Design for Distribution Automation is jointly validated with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL). It tackles comprehensive FLISR use case coverage, including fault, broken jumper, loss of source, and overload. It accounts for urban to rural terrain and various distance and interference levels.\nInnovations have been made to Cisco Resilient Mesh to provide higher performance, lower latency, enhanced security, and peer-to-peer communication, as well as support edge computing. In the joint DA solution validation with SEL, Cisco Resilient Mesh is proven to support feeders with multiple loops or 10-hop linear topology to reconfigure within 30 seconds, much faster than SAIDI/SAIFI\xe2\x80\x99s criteria. Cisco Resilient Mesh consists of 1240/1120 Connected Grid Routers, IR530 Resilient Mesh Range Extenders, IR510 WPAN Gateways, and IoT Field Network Director (FND) network management system.\nIn order to provide a single pane-of-glass management for multi-service FAN, Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) is the network management system for the entire IoT Field Area Network. It provides a universal management experience for Cisco Resilient Mesh, as well as public or private LTE network enabled by Cisco 1101 Industrial Integrated Services Router. Cisco FND provides secure, zero-touch deployment at scale and currently manages over 8 million endpoints. Cisco IoT Field Network Director provides real-time critical infrastructure monitoring with geographical visualization of all network assets and enterprise-class visibility for gateways and endpoints. It also supports field device lifecycle management and application management.\nWith the advanced solution capabilities and validation combined with real Distribution Automation use cases, the DA Cisco Validated Design will enable power utilities to build modernized distribution grid with increased reliability, higher efficiency, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), enhanced security, and smooth DER integration. This solution was presented by Cisco at the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) Telecom & Technology Event 2020.

116,"Making mass transit simple, secure and scalable",RJ Mahadev,"b'This is part of a blog post series discussing how you enable a simple, secure and scalable infrastructure for mass transit. As was discussed in my previous blog post on \xe2\x80\x9cThe three Ss of remote and mobile assets,\xe2\x80\x9d if you manage a fleet \xe2\x80\x93 whether for mass transit, mobile services or first responders \xe2\x80\x93 you probably face two dueling challenges. You\xe2\x80\x99re expected to ensure stability and continuous operations even as your budget is flat or declining. Add in the massive shift in mass transit ridership in 2020, and you have a good reason to hit pause as you rethink how you meet the new safety measures and  provide the right infrastructure to deliver the technology experience riders prefer. This includes supporting capabilities like social distancing, mobility on demand (MoD), contactless payment, on-board Wi-Fi and matching the experience ride sharing companies have established.\nUnfortunately, this is difficult when the on-board network has been layered on over time, resulting in a complex and expensive data center on wheels. For evidence, look at the \xe2\x80\x9cporcupines\xe2\x80\x9d on top of most buses \xe2\x80\x93 that is, the collections of multi-vendor antennas required for connectivity across disparate systems and services. Multiply the costs and complexity across an entire fleet and it becomes clear that the status quo is unsustainable.\nLegacy systems are expensive to maintain, incapable of scaling to meet rider expectations and fraught with security vulnerabilities. How can public transit organizations address these challenges? The answer is to create a fleet of smart buses powered by a multi-service network that can evolve with the requirements.\nCisco has developed a solution that combines secure, multi-function routing with native edge compute \xe2\x80\x93 in other words, a single box that delivers needed connectivity for everything from payment and location services to dynamic signage and maintenance monitoring. Our solution also offers gateway and SIM management that can be maintained by mechanics \xe2\x80\x93 no IT involvement required.\nThis solution is the perfect vehicle to get mass transit organizations where they need to go.\nSimple unified management of gateways, and remote and mobile assets, so bus mechanics and non-IT staff can deploy and maintain thousands of smart buses with integrated fleet, vehicle, and mass transit operations.\nSecure infrastructure platform that can integrate with the enterprise security fabric to provide a single control point for managing cybersecurity threats. Customers have derived numerous benefits from this including enabling two-way data flows using VPNs, more effective content filtering and edge security as well as secure access to support remote troubleshooting and updates.\nScalable infrastructure based on robust hardware and operating systems that have been field tested across millions of deployments, custom silicon to provide greater throughput and reliability and an open ecosystem of edge compute capabilities to support next-generation applications.\nFocus on simple, secure and scalable design principles to allow your mass transit system to be optimized as you link your existing assets with the applications that can provide your business a new digital future. Settle for nothing less than an infrastructure purpose built to support the needs of real-time IoT data, a mix of different technologies and integrated asset operation.\nWant to know more?

117,Cisco continues to lead growth of Wi-SUN Field Area Network,Paul Duffy,"b'For nearly a decade, Cisco has been committed to supporting the Wi-SUN Alliance \xe2\x80\x93 whose mission it is to drive the adoption of interoperable smart utility networks. As part of that commitment, Cisco has been offering Wi-SUN certified products to help with secure utility and smart city deployments, and has been actively working with member companies to define, test, and deliver a common open-standards based profile for this interoperability.\nThe Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) now provides utilities and smart cities with an IPv6-based interoperable, secure, wide area wireless mesh network that can support multiple IoT use cases including utility metering,  distribution automation, distributed energy resource control, municipal lighting, parking management and EV charging stations.\nThe FAN provides device interoperability for network discovery, association, authentication, key exchange and rotation, encryption, IPv6 RPL routing, and address assignment operating over sub -GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio. The ability to operate multiple use cases using multiple vendor devices co-resident on a common FAN is a key benefit sought by customers to reduce costs associated with what were typically multiple, dedicated purpose legacy networks.\nWith more than 15 million IPv6 Cisco Resilient Mesh endpoints in operation, the latest Cisco CGR 1000 IOS and Resilient Mesh software releases with Wi-SUN FAN 1.0 support will pave the way to wide adoption of the FAN protocol stack.\nEcosystem of products expands\nIn April of 2019, the Wi-SUN Alliance announced the first products to achieve Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) 1.0 certification. Cisco was one of the first to certify a FAN product with the Cisco IR509 and continues to lead with the largest collection of certified FAN products including the IR510, IR529, IR 530, CGR1120, CGR 1240,  as well as Resilient Mesh endpoint reference design. There are today more than 30 products certified from multiple vendors, and the list continues to grow.\nSolutions in action\nAt DistribuTECH 2020, Wi-SUN members collaborated to demonstrate the first multi-vendor Wi-SUN FAN network, featuring certified FAN devices from multiple vendors operating across the show floor. The demonstration can be viewed here.\nFeature additions coming\nIn parallel with ongoing FAN 1.0 certifications, Wi-SUN is busy working on the next phase of FAN to include additional RF region support, higher data rate modulations, and low power operation \xe2\x80\x93 all of which will be backwards compatible with FAN 1.0.\nMembership continues to grow\nThe Wi-SUN Alliance membership today includes 200+ semiconductor and product vendors, service providers, utilities, universities, enterprises, municipalities, and government organizations from 27 countries.  We at Cisco are very excited to be a member among this prolific group of organizations and continue to do our part in driving this adoption of interoperable smart utility networks.\nLooking for a resilient, proven, standards-based solution for a city-scale IoT deployment?

118,Face mask detection with ML/AI on Cisco industrial hardware,Daniel Eckstein,"b'Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked to create an architecture that can apply analytics on very voluminous data such as video streams generated from cameras. Given the volume and sensitivity of the data, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to send it off-premises for analysis. Also, the anticipated cost of centralizing the data might invalidate your business value assessment for your use case. You could apply machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge\xe2\x80\x94but only if you can make it work with the available compute resources.\nThis is the exact challenge I recently tackled with the help of my colleague, Michael Wielpuetz.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy or even possible to change or scale the available compute resources in a typical edge scenario. A ML- or AI-enabled software stack consists of libraries, frameworks, and trained analytical models. In relation to the available resources at the network edge, the frameworks and the models tend to be large in size. Additionally, such setups often require multiple CPU-, or even GPU-enabled environments during operation.\nTo provide food for thought, to incubate new ideas, and to proof possibility, Michael Wielpuetz and I started in our free time to minimize the resource requirement of an exemplary setup. We thought about a use case that relates to a current public challenge: detect human faces on a video stream and whether those faces are covered with a protection mask.\nWe decided to create a base Docker image that allows us to host two stacked neural networks: The first neural network to detect all faces in a video stream, and the second neural network to detect masks on the faces found. To minimize the container, as well as to have it available across x86_64 and ARM64 architectures, we compiled, cross-compiled, and minimized the footprint of all components from gigabyte to megabyte size. To allow using one of the smallest possible AI frameworks, we transformed, quantized, and stripped the trained models. We decided to invest the extra effort for optimizing the frameworks and libraries because when we started there was no ready-to-use installable package available for the most recent versions of the components.\nSee how the standard Docker images compare to our base image:\nThe final size of our image on ARM64 is 184MB, and there is still potential for further optimization.\nBoth neural networks are embedded into an application that allows dynamic configuration, such as configuring the video stream to be used, defining the resolution and the sampling rate, and more. These settings have a major impact on the throughput and data availability latency of the setup.\nOn the systems we tested, the throughput was up to five frames per second at a resolution of 720p with only a part of the available resources made available to the Docker container to allow for multiple containers to be hosted at the same time. The optimal setting and required throughput depend on the use case requirements. Many of the use cases we thought of are perfectly fine with one frame per second or even less.\nThe internal architecture of the Docker container is as follows:\nSince the base Docker image works with configurable video streams, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to think of additional use cases. It becomes an exercise of replacing or retraining the model to cover other scenarios based on video streams to enable use cases like detecting room occupation, people counting, threat detection, object detection and many more.\nHere is an example of the setup in action. The video will show you:\nin the first segment, the dynamically anonymized faces are detected\nin the second segment, a visual representation of the analytical result, including the face location, the facial features, as well as the probability that the person is wearing a mask\nin the third segment, the original input video stream with a visualization of the detections\nin the fourth segment, the output of the setup\nThe fourth segment is exactly what this setup will provide to external consumers. To maintain privacy, the setup will not send video or image data outbound.\nThere is still room for optimizing the accuracy of the analytical results. For this first setup, we intentionally set our focus on the proof of possibility and resource allocation reduction of performing ML and AI at the edge, rather than creating a ready-to-use product.\nWe plan on creating a handful of other examples based on video, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn our focus to machine telemetry and how we can use this approach on high dimensional data. Our plan is to continue to release different Docker images for different use cases to help others getting started with ML and AI at the edge.\nYou can find the Docker image here.\nShare'",Tags: Artificial Intelligence (AI) data docker Internet of Things (IoT) machine learning mask detection ML,"August 25, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Daniel-Eckstein-150x150.png
119,The future of traffic management,Kyle Connor,"b'The transportation industry is going through a resurgence. Everything is increasing: traffic, congestion, the percentage of connected cars on the road \xe2\x80\x93 even the number of pedestrians. Transportation agencies need to respond to these changes to improve public safety and make travel easier for drivers and passerby. Fortunately, the internet of things (IoT) can play a pivotal role in Vision Zero, a multi-national road traffic safety project aiming to put a stop to fatalities and serious injuries involving road traffic.\nToday, fewer than 3,000 jurisdictions across the United States perform traffic management from physical centers. Less than 30 percent of signalized intersections are \xe2\x80\x9cconnected\xe2\x80\x9d via dedicated, private networks. While intersections with advanced detection capture significant amounts of data, it\xe2\x80\x99s not stored, aggregated, shared, or analyzed. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to conduct remote monitoring and optimization when cities have limited connectivity, heterogeneous environments, and a lack of software tools. As a result, data is generally stranded at each intersection, where it offers little or no value.\nDue to the advances in vehicle communications technologies, cities and roadway operators are rapidly deploying improved connectivity to the roadside. The goal is to have 100 percent of signalized intersections interconnected and cloud ready. Data collected at intersections with advanced detection will be seamlessly stored, aggregated, analyzed, shared, and processed. The availability of pervasive connectivity, data standards, and advanced software apps will enable remote monitoring and optimization. As a result, traffic management will be performed from cloud-based centers, creating significant operating efficiencies.\nThe future of traffic management is starting today, in cities like Las Vegas. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been to Vegas, you know how congested the streets can get \xe2\x80\x94 both with people and vehicles. To make matters more complicated, pedestrians aren\xe2\x80\x99t always in a sound state of mind, so drivers have to be extra careful to watch for those crossing the street in random places. The city needed a better understanding of pedestrian incidents to be able to proactively prevent them \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s where Cisco came in.\nAs part of our connected intersection deployment, Cisco led a proof of concept for connected vehicle technology in which we leveraged the vehicle as a sensor. Las Vegas was able to listen to vehicles with connected technology to learn about emergency breaking conditions and traction control issues. This capability proved especially valuable during inclement weather: the city was able to improve safety conditions by identifying where vehicles were having traction control issues (i.e. hydroplaning). Going forward the city will be able to proactively respond by either fixing the conditions for future storms or sending out rapid response teams during an event. Not only was Las Vegas able to aggregate data, they now have the power to act on it.\nLas Vegas is just one use case for connected intersections. The insights obtained from sensored traffic signals can be used to maintain and adapt operational management. Traffic control centers can proactively respond to changing traffic conditions and outages, improve traffic safety and signal performance, and enhance the citizen experience \xe2\x80\x94 all while reducing costs by operating in the cloud.\nAt Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing insights to traffic management centers and traffic operators so they can help reduce and respond to delays in real time by using analytics and signal performance measurement.

Our IoT portfolio is based our industry-leading networking and security capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 so we can offer a complete and diverse set of products for virtually any location, need or deployment scenario.\nAnd we never stop improving our portfolio. Cisco hardware spans switches, routers, gateways, and access points with best-in-class networking features, industrial protocol interoperability, and the right form factor and design for different deployment scenarios. Our software includes a wealth of products to support every IoT deployment from networking configuration to security to data management.\nProgrammability and automation\nThe second driver of our growth and leadership is our use of Industrial NetDevOps to empower customers to scale the Cisco IoT portfolio with programmability and automation. Industrial NetDevOps takes advantage of IT and OT working together using automation to save time and costs and enable automated IT network services for operations professionals. It also makes it possible to get real-time data about the health of an industrial network and the devices that run on it.\nTested-and-tried architectures\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t just make great products; we also ensure that our products work great together! We have built a series of reference architectures for various industries. These architectures are tested and validated to help ensure the success of customer deployments. They help eliminate guesswork and accelerate implementation \xe2\x80\x93 so an industrial network can start delivering value more quickly and reliably.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99re proud of this latest recognition (and others, including a Global Leadership Award from Frost & Sullivan, an Interop Best in Show recognition and an IoT Breakthrough Award).

121,The three Ss of remote and mobile assets,RJ Mahadev,"b'This is the first in a series of blog posts discussing the importance of a simple, secure and scalable infrastructure for remote and mobile assets.  If you manage a fleet \xe2\x80\x93 whether for mass transit, mobile services or first responders \xe2\x80\x93 you probably face two dueling challenges. You\xe2\x80\x99re expected to ensure stability and continuous operations even as your budget is flat or declining. Almost anyone who oversees traffic intersections, highway technologies and pipelines likely faces a similar dilemma.\nWelcome to the world of remote and mobile assets \xe2\x80\x93 where, for decades, the primary technology requirements have been \xe2\x80\x9cmake it cheap\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake it last.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut, as they say, winter is coming. In this world, this new season includes changing customer requirements, new types of competition, different economic models and dynamic security threats. These are changes severe enough to threaten the economic viability of any asset operator that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adapt. These changes demand operators embrace a hybrid environment combining get-the-job-done legacy technology with next-generation cloud-based technologies that bring the best of the Internet to the world of connected assets.\nHow can operators accelerate this critical journey?\nSimple, secure and scalable infrastructure\nThe need to connect legacy devices with new applications causes the greatest amount of stress on the infrastructure. Should the architecture adhere to the legacy principles (make it cheap, make it last)? Or should it embrace the complexity of constantly evolving IT capabilities that can effectively respond to new requirements and security threats?\nI believe the answer lies in the three Ss of remote and mobile assets:\nSimple solutions will be embraced by operations staff and more easily integrated into existing asset operations. The goal: to mask the complex IT architectures and configurations built to accommodate thousands of potential needs within enterprise networks. Instead, use templated designs and configurations based on industry use cases and best practices. These narrow your options \xe2\x80\x93 offering a few ways to quickly deploy and integrate the new capabilities into existing asset operations and processes.\nSecure solutions ensure that you preserve asset availability and operational integrity. That\xe2\x80\x99s especially key when these assets are away from the protection of a campus environment and local area networks. With the gateway often the front door to your network, you need extra layers of security to block rogue devices and unexpected traffic. The other part of \xe2\x80\x9csecure\xe2\x80\x9d is ensuring you safeguard the end-to-end data stream \xe2\x80\x93 from the edge on a city street to the supporting application in a distant data center or cloud. This second \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x9d also requires built-in layers of security to examine data for unexpected content and data packets.\nScalable solutions make it possible for thousands of assets to operate continuously in the wild. Scalability also positions you to evolve to meet future requirements. To deliver it, you need a robust infrastructure with underlying hardware and operating systems that can accommodate changing needs \xe2\x80\x93 as well as offer the flexibility to support new applications and the digital life of the asset. With this third \xe2\x80\x9cs,\xe2\x80\x9d you gain new ways of managing and transforming data at its source so your business can derive new insights faster. And, finally, you unlock support for an open ecosystem of customer and partner microservices that enable new business outcomes.\nFocus on simple, secure and scalable design principles to allow your infrastructure to be optimized as you link your legacy assets with the applications that can provide your business a new digital future.

122,A successful RFP for IoT: Five considerations for IoT at the edge,Vernon Turner,"b'While the data generated from an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment holds a lot of promise, it can also hold a lot of complexity and risk. At the moment, 58 percent of IoT projects fail and only about 25 percent of companies derive business value from IoT. To improve success rates, organizations need to carefully think through a number of elements before writing a Request for Proposal (RFP). In no particular order, here are five of the ten factors to consider for IoT at the edge, taken from my paper, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Top 10 Considerations for IoT at the Edge.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLight edge vs. heavy edge\nAs you go about planning your IoT implementation, you have flexibility in where you perform analytics, machine learning, etc. However, performing these functions at the edge requires additional infrastructure (read: investment). A light (weight) edge is a relatively simple solution that gives a user compute, storage, security, and network functions to allow them to connect, run, and lightly process data or send outcomes to be handled by the cloud. Compare this to a heavy (weight) edge solution that has a full stack of technology that enables \xe2\x80\x9ccycles\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 heavy applications such as analytics, machine learning, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 to do actual work at the edge of the network. If you prefer a thinner edge, you can collect the data and get it out as quickly as possible or perform preprocessing at the edge with minimum compute and send the rest to the cloud. The choice is yours, but regardless of what you select, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the implications of that choice.\nData management and analytics\nMuch like light edge or heavy edge, the decisions you make about data management and analytics will have far-reaching implications. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to consider, including how much data you have, what you want to do with it, whether you\xe2\x80\x99ll run artificial intelligence or machine learning to perform analytics and predictions \xe2\x80\x94 and, of course, how you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage it. You need the technology, but do you also have the people and are they properly skilled?\nSecurity\nThis is a no-brainer, right? An IoT deployment requires enterprise-grade security controls and best practices. Think network segmentation and defense-in-depth. At a minimum you need security on the hardware, network, applications, and data layer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cut corners here!\nGovernance\nData governance, like security, is essential. Governance is about protecting your intellectual property \xe2\x80\x94 IoT data \xe2\x80\x94 by ensuring that the right data is going to the right place at the right time and is accessed by the right person and the right IoT asset. For example, you get to choose if a piece of data goes back to a robot vendor or a cloud service provider. Not only do you have the right to make these choices, but you must do so. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you risk the wrath of regulatory compliance auditors, privacy laws such as GDPR, or even industrial espionage and sabotage.\nIntegration\nIntegrating the technology that comprises an IoT solution at the edge is no easy feat. You\xe2\x80\x99ll likely have hardware, software, a gateway management platform, compute, storage, application, and data management solutions \xe2\x80\x94 all from different vendors. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky to find a systems integrator who can do this (pricey) work. To reduce complexity and costs, look for a vendor that provides a simple solution that does the integration for you.\nAs I mentioned at the opening, these are just five requirements taken from a recent guide I put together. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to dive deeper into the five requirements I\xe2\x80\x99ve introduced here and five additional that will help reduce the risk of your IoT deployment, read \xe2\x80\x9cThe Top 10 Considerations for IoT at the Edge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Share'",Tags: analytics data edge Governance Internet of Things (IoT) RFP security,"August 3, 2020",https://alln-extcloud-storage.cisco.com/Cisco_Blogs:blogs/1/2020/02/IL20200203213922-Vernon-Turner-scaled-150x150.jpg
123,Securing industrial IoT: a guide to selecting your architecture,Fabien Maisl,"b'As organizations are increasingly connecting industrial control networks to the IT environment, cloud applications, and remote workers, the airgap created by the demilitarized zone (DMZ) erodes, and new ways to secure operational technology (OT) networks must be deployed.\nA security solution must take into account the needs of both IT and OT \xe2\x80\x93 providing robust security without increasing operational overhead or network complexity. To choose the best solution for your organization, you need to understand the implications of the various security architectures available to you. In this post, we outline a guide to selecting the right architecture to secure industrial IoT.\nGetting started\nThe first step to securing an industrial IoT network is to obtain visibility. You need to understand what devices are on the network, what they are communicating, and where those communications are going. However, traditional industrial control networks weren\xe2\x80\x99t built to provide these insights.\nFortunately, the technology to achieve network visibility is available today. Deep packet inspection (DPI) decodes all communication flows and extracts message contents and packet headers, providing the visibility to understand what devices you need to secure and what they are communicating. Not only does this let you build the right security policies, it also gives you the ability to detect abnormal behaviors such as illegitimate commands to machines that could have disastrous effects.\nSelecting your architecture\nWhen collecting network packets to perform DPI, security solution providers typically employ one of two architectures:\nConfigure network switches to send traffic to a central server that performs DPI\nDeploy dedicated security appliances on each network switch\nWhile both approaches can deliver network visibility, they also create new challenges. Configuring network switches to send traffic to a central server requires duplicating network flows, which can be complex and costly. The additional network congestion can also create network latency \xe2\x80\x94 often an unacceptable compromise.\nDeploying a security appliance addresses the issues associated with duplicating network traffic. The appliance collects and analyzes network traffic at the switch and only sends metadata to a server for additional analysis. However, full visibility requires the installation, management, and maintenance of dedicated hardware for each and every switch on the network. This can quickly lead to cost and scalability challenges. And to be effective, security requires full visibility. Even leaving one switch \xe2\x80\x9cin the dark\xe2\x80\x9d introduces risk.\nAn alternative approach\nThere is a better way to achieve full network visibility and a third architectural approach: deploy industrial-grade switches with native DPI capability. This eliminates the need to duplicate network flows and deploy additional appliances. Obtaining visibility and security functionality is simply a matter of activating a feature within the switch. Cost, traffic, and operational overhead are all minimized.\nEmbedding DPI in the network switch affords both IT and OT unique benefits. IT can leverage its existing skillset to secure the OT network without having to manage additional hardware or network traffic. OT can obtain visibility into operations that it\xe2\x80\x99s never had before as the entire industrial network traffic can now be analyzed, providing valuable analytical insights into control systems.\nAs you evaluate OT security solutions, be aware of their architectural implications. To simplify deployment and make it scalable, the best option is to embed security capabilities into the switch. This requires network equipment that has industrial compute capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 look for DPI-enabled switches that are designed for industrial IoT.\nThis is the approach we adopted with Cisco Cyber Vision. It leverages a unique edge computing architecture that enables security monitoring components to run within our industrial network equipment, thus providing visibility, operational insights, and holistic threat detection for the OT environment.\nThe benefits of Cisco Cyber Vision aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited to organizations with Cisco networks \xe2\x80\x93 the sensor is also available within the Cisco IC3000 appliance that analyses traffic at the edge by connecting to your legacy network devices. This provides maximum deployment flexibility to meet your needs with your existing network, while giving you time to replace older switches with DPI-enabled network equipment that\xe2\x80\x99s capable of seeing everything that attaches to it.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more, check out the white paper, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Edge Architecture Approach to Securing Industrial IoT Networks,\xe2\x80\x9d in which we further explore the three security architectures introduced here and how embedding DPI in the network switch meets the needs of both IT and OT.\nShare'",Tags: architecture Cisco Cyber Vision deep packet inspection IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) security,"July 30, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
124,Cisco Edge Intelligence globally available as Port of Rotterdam completes field trial,Anoop Mohan,"b'The new decade has brought in a new normal where the principles that built the Internet of Things (IoT) have been accelerated. Real-time data from physical assets is foundational, remote access is more critical than ever, and automation continues to improve efficiency. At Cisco IoT, we are laser focused on helping our customers achieve that. We help them digitize their operations to achieve business outcomes and improve operational efficiency. To that end, Cisco announced the launch of Edge Intelligence in January 2020 at Cisco Live Europe. And in the last six months, this IoT offering has been validated by our customers through successful field trials. Today, I am extremely proud to announce the orderability of Cisco Edge Intelligence to our global customer base.\nFor our new readers, here is a quick recap of Cisco Edge Intelligence \xe2\x80\x93 it is a plug-and-play IoT software solution tightly integrated with Cisco Edge Gateways. It greatly simplifies IoT data extraction, transformation, and delivery to multi destinations with granular data policies for governance. It is remotely managed and configured using a SaaS (Software as a Service) based web portal. Customers can configure their remote assets across an abundance of locations, filter and send the data to their destination with zero coding within a matter of minutes (yes minutes!)\nFor advanced customers, it provides a plugin to Microsoft Visual Studio code, where developers can write simple to complex analytics scripts using well-known JavaScript, remotely debug and push the scripts to an almost infinite number of gateways using Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-based management services.\nOver the last six months, Cisco completed early field trials with several customers. Use cases have varied from geographically distributed assets in Oil & Gas (O&G) wells, water distribution facilities, remote vessels/fleets to high-value industrial assets. In each of these pilots, Cisco Edge Intelligence has proven to be highly valuable to our customers, catapulting them from concept to outcome. Given the frequency of IoT projects not getting through their Proof of Concept stage, this success rate is a high point for both our early field trial customers and Cisco.\nPort of Rotterdam completes early field trial\nOne of our early field trial customers, the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, uses Cisco Edge Intelligence to remotely manage their patrol vessels. A patrol vessel is a data mine and generates thousands of data points per second. Its operators need to visualize and analyze that data to help with operations such as predictive maintenance and helping improve emergency response times. The goal was to extract, transform and deliver data to their analytics application. They went from having an architecture discussion with Cisco to implementing Cisco Edge Intelligence and deriving value from data in less than two weeks!\nJouke Dijkstra, the IoT Architect for the Port of Rotterdam summed it up well, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pilot project with Cisco Edge Intelligence demonstrated viability, proved value in record time unlike anything we have seen before and with much lower budget that we can anticipated.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs a thought leader and an early pilot customer, we are very excited to share a new case study on Port of Rotterdam\xe2\x80\x99s field trial of Edge Intelligence. Read the full case study here.\nPartnering for success\nBeyond the early use cases we\xe2\x80\x99ve started with our customers, our partnership strategy with cloud and IoT platform vendors has been a cornerstone for the early success of Edge Intelligence. Our customers have used Edge Intelligence to bring data home to their applications residing on Azure IoT hub, Software AG Cumulocity and in many cases MQTT servers running on various cloud and on-prem infrastructures. Cisco is focused on extending this ecosystem of partners and expanding validated solution that works simply for its customers.\nThe Cisco Edge Intelligence team is committed to building on this success and help deliver business value to our IoT customers. We are now open for business, and we look forward to learning and helping our customers with their IoT needs. Want to learn more about IoT Edge and Cisco Edge Intelligence?

125,Grid security: One utility company’s journey to the edge,Sean Song Jiang,"b'For many large, long-standing utility companies, the edge of the operational technology (OT) network operates in shadows. Sites are numerous, widely dispersed, and sometimes so old that it is almost impossible to keep track of what assets are running or what they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating to. With critical infrastructure increasingly coming online, securing assets and operations is a priority \xe2\x80\x94 and you can\xe2\x80\x99t secure what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Plus, visibility is a pre-requisite for meeting NERC-CIP (North American Electric Reliability Corporation-Critical Infrastructure Protection) and EU NIS (European Union Network and Information Security Directive) regulatory requirements.\nA large utility company came to Cisco for help overcoming its security and compliance challenges. The company lacked the visibility needed to secure the grid and meet its regulatory compliance requirements. It wanted to understand what assets were at the edge and how they were operating \xe2\x80\x93 what was considered normal operations and what was abnormal \xe2\x80\x93 and it needed to do it all at scale. This was no easy task: the existing architecture consisted of more than 500 substations. The utility needed a single solution that it could seamlessly deploy in a large-scale manner, with verifiable integration.\nThis is exactly the scenario that Cisco Cyber Vision is designed for. The integrated industrial security solution leverages a highly scalable, two-tier architecture consisting of a central appliance and lightweight software-based sensors. The Cyber Vision sensors decode grid protocols such as DNP3/IP, IEC 61850 GOOSE and MMS, IEC 101/104 and more, providing visibility and insight into all the assets on the network, including what they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating and who they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating to. The sensors are embedded into industrial switches, making it easy to deploy at scale throughout the production, transmission, and distribution networks, enabling the power company to obtain visibility into all the traffic.\nShutting power off in a city just takes a legitimate instruction to a breaker. Cisco Cyber Vision monitors application flows against baselines, defining what normal should look like. Anomalous behaviors that could indicate an attack can now be identified with no delay. Integration with the security operations center (SOC) provides security leaders with a holistic view of the OT environment and threat activity.\nCisco Cyber Vision also eases the burden of achieving regulatory compliance. It builds asset inventories and captures operational insights, such as asset modifications and variable changes, that are needed to meet NERC-CIP and EU NIS requirements. Leveraging the network to collect this data helps reduce the time and cost to ensure regulatory compliance.\nTo help ensure a smooth implementation and full integration of Cyber Vision, the utility company used a Cisco Validated Design (CVD). A CVD is an architectural blueprint for a specific use case designed and tested by Cisco engineers with Cisco equipment. The Grid Security Design Guide is designed for utility companies implementing a holistic security architecture that includes Cisco Cyber Vision and Cisco networking hardware. Leveraging the CVD reduced the utility\xe2\x80\x99s risk while implementing a fully integrated IoT security architecture.\nWith Cisco Cyber Vision successfully implemented, the utility company gained valuable discoverability and insight into assets that were potentially vulnerable at the edge. This included devices that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been touched in ten or more years that had fallen off the inventory list but were still operating in substations hundreds of miles away, creating both a security and regulatory compliance risk. The IT security organization was able to identify those devices and where they were connected, and quickly address the security vulnerabilities that were creating a risk exposure.\nWith visibility and the ability to detect cyberattacks, the power utility gained confidence in its security posture at the edge and throughout the network. This visibility also gave the OT organization valuable insights into industrial processes, reduced the organization\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory risk, and enhanced IT/OT collaboration.

126,Frost & Sullivan praises Cisco’s IoT security strategy with Global Leadership Award,Fabien Maisl,"b'With industrial organizations deploying IoT technologies and connecting their industrial assets to more applications, cybersecurity has become a top priority to capture the benefits of all these digitization efforts. Being the leader in both the cybersecurity and industrial networking markets, Cisco is making heavy investments to bridge the two and enable secure Industry 4.0 deployments.\nWe are very happy to share with you that Cisco just received Frost & Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s 2020 Global Enabling Technology Leadership Award for industrial control systems cybersecurity. Frost & Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s Best Practices Awards recognize companies that have identified emerging trends before they became a marketplace standard and have created advanced technologies that will catalyze and transform industries in the near future.\nProtecting industrial operations is a very specific challenge. Industrial processes cannot be stopped, and disruption can lead to dramatic human or environmental hazards. Cyberattacks are particularly difficult to detect as they can look like legitimate instructions to assets. Industrial automation technologies can be quite old and have not been designed with security in mind. They generally use specific communication protocols that IT security tools do not understand. In fact, many organizations don\xe2\x80\x99t even have an accurate inventory of industrial assets installed in their networks.\nIoT/OT security projects require visibility into industrial assets, their communications, and the industrial processes they support. Gaining this visibility is key to implement security best practices such as network segmentation, but also to detect malicious traffic and process anomalies that could be early sign of a custom attack. With all this information, security analysts have insights and context to build and enforce security policies as well as to investigate and remediate threats.\nThe combination of Cisco Cyber Vision and Cisco industrial network equipment helps our customers gain this visibility and detect threats at scale throughout their industrial operations. Fully integrated with Cisco SecureX and the entire suite of Cisco security solutions, Frost & Sullivan is recognizing our efforts to bridge the gap between OT and IT so that our customers can build a unified IT/OT threat management strategy.\nFor industrial organizations to drive their IoT projects to success, Cisco also offers a step-by-step approach that helps kick start their IoT security projects by leveraging OT/IT security consulting services from Cisco CX as well as architecture guidelines and deployment methodologies with our Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs).\nSamir Sakpal, Director of Consulting, ICT \xe2\x80\x93 Americas, Growth Consulting for Frost & Sullivan explains, \xe2\x80\x9cCisco is uniquely positioned to excel in industrial IoT security.

127,Private cellular networks: Worthy of the hype?,Ken Davidson,"b'I talk with customers on a daily basis and I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed a big uptick in questions about private networks over the past months. As IoT grows, access technologies are expanding to serve evolving needs. Private cellular networks are another wireless connectivity option and are earning a lot of attention because they address some very common pain points organizations experience today.\nClean spectrum: Spectrum availability is perhaps the single most important asset when it comes to connecting devices. Clean spectrum ensures no competing network traffic, which creates tremendous reliability. Private LTE/5G spectrum, as it is being allocated by countries across the globe offers clean new spectrum without having to worry about interference issues that come with unlicensed spectrum.\nCoverage: Private cellular provides far broader coverage with fewer access points which is especially useful where deploying large numbers of access points is logistically challenging or impossible (for instance in a sporting arena or outdoor concert venue).\nReliable handover: Mobile assets serving mission critical use cases require reliable handovers between networks as they move from one location to another. Private cellular networks offer reliable handover and enable a higher level of digitization.\nSecurity: The inherent security of cellular networks offers the protection, visibility and network control to keep your business safe.\nFlexibility: Private cellular networks give organizations the freedom to make technical and economic choices that best suit their requirements. They can manage private networks themselves or buy them as a managed service from a cellular service provider/MVNO.\nIn February, Cisco IoT Control Center, the leading connectivity management platform announced the capability to support service provider-powered private cellular networks, targeting 5G standalone readiness before the end of 2020. The 5G benefits of speed, density and ultra-low latency combined with the flexibility of private cellular networks hold the promise of unlocking massive innovation with far higher levels of digitization. We have also made investments in eSIM technology which has applicability for private cellular use cases by enabling on the fly re-programming of SIMs.\nJust as we dove into what a 5G-powered smart city could look like, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about how a couple industries are benefiting from private LTE and private 5G networks both today and tomorrow.\nPrivate cellular in manufacturing\nMobile robots and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) work with great precision and require low latency (<10ms) over a broad area. If the network is patchy, hand-offs lack reliability or if latency increases intermittently, AGVs can stall and production can grind to a halt. Private cellular, especially private 5G can keep a manufacturing floor humming.\nFor Connected Car OEM\xe2\x80\x99s, new cars need to be flashed with software and firmware as they move down the assembly line. The files are large \xe2\x80\x93 tens of gigabytes. With a private 5G network, a car OEM has the reliable network capacity to flash many cars simultaneously.\nPrivate cellular in healthcare\nPrivate cellular powered push-to-talk devices in hospitals can easily connect every staff member through phones, with no hand off or interference related issues.\nPrivate cellular can also provide coverage for mission critical connectivity of healthcare equipment. This coverage can allow hospital staff to monitor patients and control intravenous dosage from centralized locations and quickly transfer large medical imagery files.\nPrivate cellular in mining\nA mine is one of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s most inhospitable environments \xe2\x80\x93 wet, dusty, with toxic gases, and surrounded by thick rock. Keeping miners safe and mining equipment connected is a big challenge.\nPrivate LTE & 5G networks can keep 21-ton automatic loaders reliably connected, allowing for autonomous operations in dangerous and unstable conditions.\nIn summary, the hype is warranted. Private cellular \xe2\x80\x93 both LTE and 5G \xe2\x80\x93 are exciting access technologies gaining popularity to address specific organizational needs around coverage, mobility, spectrum availability, security and flexibility, while complementing Wi-Fi and public cellular access technologies. I encourage you to begin with the use cases you need to power. This video of the private 5G-powered manufacturing facility will help spur your imagination to consider the possibilities. You may discover, as many are, that private cellular networks offer an exciting new way to unlock innovation and value.\n  Share'",Tags: 5G cellular eSIM healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing Mining network,"July 23, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1536255975-bpfull.jpg
128,The “route” stuff: Interop20 Tokyo names Cisco IR1101 Best of Show,Tarannum Parkar,"b'When extending networks to industrial application environments, enterprises must overcome a number of challenges \xe2\x80\x93 most notably, reliable connectivity. Industrial environments are subject to extreme temperatures, dust, water splash and vibration. The ability to deploy and manage industrial networks remotely is critical due to the large scale of operations and the inhospitable environments in which some of these deployments reside. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, these industrial environments need highly secure, rugged routers to overcome the growing number of cyber-attacks they face.\nTo meet these challenges and more, we\xe2\x80\x99re excited to announce that the Cisco IR1101 Industrial Integrated Services Router has won the Best of Show in the Industry Network Category at Interop Tokyo 2020.\nThe Cisco IR1101 is a secure, compact, ruggedized, high-bandwidth router with a modular design that extends connectivity to the edge. Its highly compact form factor makes it ideal for remote asset management across multiple industrial vertical markets such as transportation, public safety, utilities, manufacturing, oil and gas and others.\nThe Cisco IR1101\xe2\x80\x99s durability makes it ideal for challenging industrial and distributed IoT deployments. For example, one Cisco customer, a large department of transportation, leverages the router for remote asset management of critical public infrastructure at traffic intersections and freeways. The department needed to create an efficient process for emergency response vehicle operators to report data by connecting a number of elements such as traffic signals, roadway sensors, weather sensors, and digital signage. The IR1101 provides redundant LTE WAN connectivity for increased reliability with the new pluggable LTE-MNA  module for public safety and first responders. With intelligence at the edge, the department of transportation can accelerate its decision making for mission-critical applications as well as improve first responder safety.\nBecause its hardware is highly modular and expandable, the IR1101 is designed to future-proof industrial IoT deployments. The pluggable modules provide the flexibility to add or upgrade WAN and storage components as technologies and business needs evolve. Its design allows enterprises to upgrade to new communications protocols when they become available (i.e. 5G), avoiding costly rip-and-replace each time a new connectivity technology comes along. It delivers secure IoT connectivity for both today and tomorrow.\nThe Cisco IR1101 is also SD-WAN capable. Its SD-WAN architecture provides a unified view with a single pane of glass, bringing simplicity at scale to the IoT edge. With SD-WAN on IR1101, enterprises can effectively manage thousands of disparate locations remotely without dispatching technicians, saving on operations costs. It enables automation of complex security setups at the IoT edge so you can prevent attacks before they happen and protect your business.\nAs a further example of the power of the Cisco IR1101, a large American power company is building a secure LTE network to resolve connectivity challenges for distribution automation in its secondary substations. Our latest pluggable, gigabit-class category 18 LTE module supports private LTE bands including CBRS in the US and high speed for industrial environments. The smart grid certification, increased EMC protection, SCADA, and industry protocols support make it ideal for this type of use case. The utilities company is able to improve overall power distribution efficiency and quality through Volt-Var optimization, saving millions of dollars. The IR1101 can be managed remotely through our cloud-based gateway dashboard making it easy to deploy and manage and providing operational visibility across hundreds of distributed sites.\nRead more about the Cisco IR1101 and contact us to discuss how it can help you solve connectivity challenges for your use case.\n  Share'",Tags: Internet of Things (IoT) interop Manufacturing router rugged SD-WAN Transportation Utilities,"July 16, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Tarannum-Rafik-Parkar-150x150.jpg
129,The key to NERC-CIP compliance and threat protection for power utilities,Sean Song Jiang,"b'As critical infrastructure, power utilities cannot afford to be at risk. However, even as utilities focus on keeping power grids up and running, they must also maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, particularly NERC-CIP (North American Electric Reliability Corporation-Critical Infrastructure Protection) and EU NIS (European Union Network and Information Security Directive). To achieve and maintain compliance, utilities need continuous visibility into assets and processes.\nFor many power utilities, much of the infrastructure operates in the dark and gaining visibility can be a significant challenge. Having grown over several decades, the infrastructure consists of a multitude of assets, some of which are very old and/or have been managed by third parties. It\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for substations to have transformers that are more than 40 years old that possess only rudimentary communication capabilities. Power utilities rarely have an up-to-date asset inventory and now, with a widely dispersed infrastructure, the prospect of obtaining visibility is daunting.\nModern industrial-grade networking hardware with embedded sensors can provide end-to-end visibility. Cisco IoT routers and switches with Cisco Cyber Vision sensors can see all the communication flows between devices. The software-based sensors capture asset inventory and operational insights, such as asset identification and location, that are needed to comply with NERC-CIP/EU NIS. Power utilities that are struggling to maintain compliance or are refreshing their substations should take the opportunity to deploy network equipment that provides visibility.\nBy activating anomaly detection features, Cisco Cyber Vision can also be leveraged in a cybersecurity project. Shutting power off in a city just takes a legitimate instruction to a breaker \xe2\x80\x93 IT security tools cannot detect that. Cisco IoT network devices with embedded Cyber Vision sensors can detect abnormal behaviors by decoding grid protocols such as DNP3/IP, IEC 104, IEC 61850 GOOSE and MMS. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ideal companion to firewalls and IDS/IPS to detect zero-day/custom-made attacks that target power utilities.\nCisco Cyber Vision is fully integrated with the wider Cisco security solution for grid networks, all of which can be implemented with the help of the Cisco Grid Security CVD. The Cisco Validated Design (CVD) is a blueprint for an integrated security architecture designed to help reduce risk and minimize the burden of regulatory compliance. The CVD aims to simplify implementation and lower operating costs for utilities while providing comprehensive protection through defense in depth.\nCisco Cyber Vision draws an ideal journey to securing grid networks while making wise use of limited budgets: leverage the network to ensure regulatory compliance, and upgrade to security when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready.

130,Moving at the speed of business: Ultra-reliable connectivity for mission-critical IoT,Vikas Butaney,"b'Perhaps the most impressive thing about Fluidmesh Networks is that they set out more than a decade ago to solve one of the hardest problems \xe2\x80\x93 bringing seamless wireless connectivity to the most challenging sites and environments. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking harsh and vast settings like high-speed trains, large-scale industrial sites, distributed infrastructures, and complex urban environments where metal is aplenty and interferes with signals. Places where connectivity and zero loss of data transfer at high speed is essential. Congrats to Fluidmesh for achieving that goal with great success. Today, we officially welcome you to Cisco and the IoT team!\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not how you\xe2\x80\x99re connected \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just that you are\nAs the leader in the industrial wireless sector, our job at Cisco is to continually deliver innovative solutions for our customers to solve real-world problems with IoT. Now, with Fluidmesh, we can further extend our IoT solutions to on-the-move applications where reliable backhaul is mission critical. At the end of the day, your employees, consumers, citizens and travelers don\xe2\x80\x99t care that it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated to manage connectivity across environments and infrastructures. They just expect a seamless experience.\nTake, for example, the challenges with autonomous and automated vehicle control in one of the most dangerous settings \xe2\x80\x93 excavating for unexploded ordnance. Here, our customer, Fort Wingate in New Mexico, has to do everything remotely. Imagine piloting a drone \xe2\x80\x93 but instead you are remotely operating heavy excavator equipment in a real potential minefield. Every decision those operators make is reliant on high resolution video that provides real-time situational awareness. Any signal degradation, even for a \xc2\xbd second, typically will halt this tele-remote operation. That video feed is mission-critical, requiring a network that is always available with no latency.\nOther organizations are solving connectivity issues that are at the heart of their business model like high-speed video and audio streaming on trains. Travelers expect a seamless experience, whether they are in underground tunnels or the remote countryside. Transportation providers need that same connectivity to deliver higher levels of security. Customers like Syndicat mixte des transport pour le Rh\xc3\xb4ne et l\xe2\x80\x99agglom\xc3\xa9ration Lyonnaise (SYTRAL) in Lyon, France are adding real-time wireless video-surveillance systems to provide continuous video streams from trains. Their new surveillance system contains more than 1000 new cameras where security personnel can monitor any camera from the main control room in real-time, regardless of the speed or position of the train.\nBoth cases require the network infrastructure to solve for many layers of complexity. Now, combining Fluidmesh technology with our existing industrial wireless portfolio, Cisco delivers that seamless experience: handover at high speeds (300km/hr+), up to 700 Mbps throughput and a \xe2\x80\x9clossless\xe2\x80\x9d technology that ensures that no data is dropped during the handover.\nBandwidth and power at the edge\nLooking across industries, we are seeing the need for seamless connectivity increasing. The growth in 4K cameras isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to autonomous operations. It extends to monitoring cities and roadways for traffic where more and more bandwidth is needed at the edge. With the needs of flexible manufacturing plants, autonomous robots, automated hauling solutions and smart port operations, resilient wireless at higher speed is being demanded by infrastructure, now. I am excited that with Fluidmesh\xe2\x80\x99s technology, Cisco can accelerate our customers\xe2\x80\x99 businesses now without delay.\nI know I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before, but the opportunity for IoT continues to amaze me. Together, we\xe2\x80\x99re making the workplace safer, delivering higher quality experiences for organizations and connecting the world during challenging times. We look forward to working closely with our new Fluidmesh customers, as well as the more than 75,000 Cisco IoT customers, on this exciting journey.\nClick here for more on Cisco IoT.\nShare'",Tags: acquisition backhaul Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul edge Internet of Things (IoT) wireless,"July 7, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
131,Three requirements to securely connect your industrial network,Tim Szigeti,"b'Digital transformation initiatives are driven by the desire to make data-driven business decisions. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to increase production, reduce waste, or improve safety, the answer resides in your data: collecting it, analyzing it, and learning from it. But what happens when your data lives in extreme locations? Perhaps in places of severe heat, cold, humidity, salinity, or dust? How do you gather information with such harsh conditions? And how do you do it securely?\nThe first step is to converge to a single IP network. Network convergence is a proven formula for pulling together all the data in your environments. Cisco has been helping hundreds of thousands of organizations to converge their voice, video, data, and IoT networks to a single IP network. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for over 30 years, and we know it works. A single network is easy to manage and operate and reduces your total cost of ownership. However, the primary challenge with a converged network is that it needs to be secure. There are three elements you need to securely connect an industrial network: 1) purpose-built hardware, 2) digitally signed and authentic security software, and 3) extensible architectures.\n1. Choosing the right hardware\nStart with the right hardware. For industrial internet of things (IIoT), the network hardware must satisfy the requirements of both the operational technology (OT) department and the IT department. At a high level, OT runs point on operations and understands how the organization produces its goods or services. IT connects the network and wants to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s done securely. OT and IT each have different priorities, goals, and concerns, yet the hardware has to meet both sets of requirements.\nIn addition to meeting the requirements of both OT and IT, the network hardware you select for connecting the industrial network should have a hardware trust anchor. A hardware trust anchor ensures that whatever software runs on the hardware will do so in a secure manner. To this end, the hardware should have an anti-theft, anti-counterfeiting, and anti-tamper chip that is completely immutable, meaning that it cannot change. Also look for built-in cryptography functions, secure storage for certificates and objects, and certifiable entropy for random number generators.\n2. Selecting the right software\nGoing up the technology stack, the next component you need to securely connect the industrial network is the right software. Complement the secure hardware with digitally signed images, a secure boot process, and runtime defenses to ensure the software is secure and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been tampered with.\nWhat is meant by digitally signed images? When we compile an image at Cisco, we execute a hash function on the binary code. The result of that hash function is encrypted using Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s private key, and that signature is embedded right within the software image. At boot time, two things happen: 1) the local machine computes its own hash based on the binary of the software image, and 2) it decrypts the information they\xe2\x80\x99re in, looking for that signature and making sure the two match. This process provides reassurance that the software hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been tampered with and that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to boot up. Digitally signed images are an important component to a secure boot process.\nNow that the software has securely loaded on the device, the network administrator has at his or her disposal the most powerful and secure networking operating system in the industry: Cisco IOS XE, which contains over 1,300 security feature commands and keyword options.\nCisco IOX XE also supports application-hosting in containers so that they can run on networking devices. Leveraging this application-hosting capability, Cisco has recently delivered an OT-specific security solution, namely Cisco Cyber Vision.\nCisco Cyber Vision provides innovation in OT security. For example, Cisco doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require customers to install dedicated hardware sensors, but rather virtualizes their sensor to run as an application on network infrastructure, such as Cisco Catalyst Industrial Ethernet (IE) switches or Cisco ISR Industrial Routers (IR) or even Cisco Catalyst 9300 switches (which may be found in some industrial environments, albeit in temperature-controlled cabinets/rooms). Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s unique approach of using a software sensor for OT protocols is not only an industry-first, but also the most scalable solution in this space, as it allows for the security solution to simply scale with the network infrastructure itself.\nAnother innovation that Cisco brings to OT security is the use of distributed analytics and OT flow metadata to minimize bandwidth impact. The Cyber Vision sensors running on the network devices perform deep packet inspection (DPI) on all OT flows. However, rather than mirroring these flows to a central analytics engine (i.e. the Cisco Cyber Vision Center) these sensors summarize OT flows as metadata, similar to NetFlow records (though the metadata Cyber Vision uses far exceeds the data contained in NetFlow records). Cisco Cyber Vision goes beyond NetFlow by detailing attributes of the devices sending and receiving the flows, the OT protocols used, the commands sent and received, and even the specific variables that these commands reference. As an analogy, while NetFlow can tell you who is talking to who, Cyber Vision metadata can tell you not only who is talking to who, but also the languages they are speaking, as well as specific details of their conversation. And the summary of these flows is highly efficient, typically consuming only 2-5 percent of incremental bandwidth.\n3. Architectural integrations\nThe third piece in the tech stack is architectural integrations. Look for security solutions that leverage the existing network hardware to provide visibility into network traffic, and to identify and stop potential threats. Both IT and OT can benefit from having complete visibility of the OT environment, but IT cannot afford the operational overhead required to support a separate SPAN network. By integrating sensors into network hardware, IT can see anomalous behavior anywhere in the environment, while OT can obtain new and deeper insights into operations.\nIdeally, the security solution also integrates with the technology used by the Security Operations Center (SOC) to monitor, investigate, and remediate security incidents in the IT environment. This way, the SOC has all the information it needs in one location to reduce the time to detect and respond to a security incident. Security analysts can see, for example, whether an attack originated in the IT environment and moved laterally to the OT environment, or if an attack entered the OT environment via something like a vulnerable device.\nHow Cisco can help\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s industrial-grade network hardware and Cisco Cyber Vision are designed to work together to meet the three requirements for securely connecting an industrial network. Our ruggedized networking switches and routers are built to withstand the harshest environmental conditions while delivering enterprise-level networking capabilities, including a hardware trust anchor. Our software uses digitally signed images to validate that software has not been tampered with, and Cisco Cyber Vision leverages the network architecture to deliver visibility and control over the OT environment. Cyber Vision also provides real-time threat detection and integrates with the SOC.\nWe recently dived into these topics with greater detail in the Cisco Live presentations, Five for Five: Five Innovations Shaping the Future of Networking and Securely Connecting Your Industrial Networks.

132,Getting more out of IoT: Turner’s Law of IoT Business Value,Vernon Turner,"b'The value of any IoT deployment starts with the data. After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the reason we deploy IoT in the first place \xe2\x80\x93 to collect data. But an IoT deployment is a sizable investment, so, how do you maximize its value? Like any good analyst (I was previously at IDC and Causeway Connections), I\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a \xe2\x80\x9claw\xe2\x80\x9d to help you optimize the business value of your IoT deployment: I call it \xe2\x80\x9cTurner\xe2\x80\x99s Law of IoT Business Value.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a nutshell, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s Law of IoT Business Value states that the business value of an IoT deployment is determined by:\nHow often data is read\nHow much data is read\nHow soon data is read once it\xe2\x80\x99s created\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s look at each of these factors.\nHow often data is read\nRegardless of what industry you\xe2\x80\x99re in, the value of your data increases the more you use it. For example, on a personal level, the sleep data on your FitBit has only so much value if you\xe2\x80\x99re the only one monitoring it. Similarly, if a manufacturer collects data from an assembly line robot, that data has a limited amount of value if it is not regularly accessed.\nYou can increase the value of data by increasing the number of times the data is used. If I share my sleep data with my doctors, it\xe2\x80\x99s now being read multiple times, and there\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic value in its analysis. If the manufacturer shares its data with the robot manufacturer, the value of that data increases because it\xe2\x80\x99s being used and interpreted by multiple parties, multiple times.\nHow much data is read\nThe business value of your IoT deployment is also influenced by the amount of data you consume. The more data you collect, the more context you have, which can lead to faster and/or more accurate business insights. If I share my sleep and heart rate data and with my doctors, they now have another factor to consider when diagnosing my health. If the manufacturer collects the robot data as well as temperature and humidity data from the plant floor, the robot manufacturer has additional information and context to troubleshoot a malfunction.\nHow soon data is read once it\xe2\x80\x99s created\nData is not cheese or wine \xe2\x80\x93 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get better with age. If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to create data, you need to use it. Otherwise, why are you creating it? Data has no business value if you\xe2\x80\x99re not using it.\nThe speed or time by which the data is read should be determined by where the data outcome needs to be processed. In other words, where do you react to the data? At the place it was created, or elsewhere? If you want to use the data in enterprise resource planning or supply chain management applications, you will probably want the data in a hybrid cloud environment. This assumes that you have built a high-speed network infrastructure to handle these requirements. Likewise, you might want to use it right away. For example, a rogue robot may need attention as soon possible so you want its data exception to be executed fast without worrying about any network delay. In our other use case, perhaps your health metrics indicate a compromised situation and it would be critical to receive a message telling you of your condition. These actions require that the data be read close to the source and in real time.\nBaby steps lead to big results\nAccording to IDC, worldwide data will grow to 175 zettabytes by the year 2025 but conservative estimates put the use of IoT data at just 2 percent. Just 2 percent! Doubling this percentage can have a huge business impact on an enterprise. If a large automobile manufacturer were to double the use of its IoT data to drive its manufacturing costs down by just 1 percent, then models show that this change could equate to 10 percent increase in profits right to the bottom line.\nCompanies are currently under utilizing IoT data and therefore are extending the time to value of most IoT solutions. The three stages outlined above show the compounding business impact of using IoT in ways that are easy to identify and implement. Businesses who take advantage of the broad access to IoT data are well positioned to become leaders in their bid to become digitally transformed.\nAnd companies can start rethinking their IoT data today.

133,"Manufacture there, connect anywhere: Cisco eSIM Flex enables global connectivity for enterprises and service providers",Ken Davidson,"b'IoT requires a variety of wireless technologies to power devices that are on the move. This strategy can get complicated when devices start moving not just across corporate campuses but between continents. Global manufacturers of IoT-enabled devices face this exact challenge: how to localize products efficiently and cost-effectively. Often IoT-enabled devices are built and tested in one region and distributed to international markets spanning across multiple continents. That means a device must be prepared to connect to different cellular networks depending on the destination to meet regulatory requirements or to achieve best price and network performance. How should manufacturers manage this given that SIM cards are network specific?\nThe answer used to be stocking and coordinating multiple SIM SKUs during the manufacturing process, and installing the right SIM either at manufacturing, or replacing SIMs on these devices after they are delivered to destination markets. Both solutions were complex, expensive and error prone.\nSIM vs. eSIM\nConnected car manufacturers have faced this problem for years and pushed for eSIM technology to solve it. An eSIM is a flexible SIM card that can be remotely reprogrammed over the air to switch to any network carrier. Install one eSIM during manufacturing and change the carrier on the fly. As manufacturers prepare for the rise of IoT-enabled products, they should look to connected car\xe2\x80\x99s example and adopt eSIM. Likewise, service providers should offer eSIM options to add differentiated value for their manufacturing customers.\nThe benefits of eSIM\nAt first glance, supporting eSIMs may not appear to benefit service providers. Why would you want to make it easier for customers to leave you? The reality, however, is that global manufacturers must simplify their manufacturing cycle and future proof their business for geographic expansion. Consequently, SIM portability is often a key requirement to bid on lucrative car OEM contracts, and other IoT verticals will follow suit. eSIM capability will be table stakes for service providers to compete for the best big manufacturing customers.\nThe eSIM dilemma for service providers\nHowever, while eSIM technology is very promising, building a global eSIM solution presents a major challenge for service providers. Even a solution involving a few service providers partners require a large number of integrations between several technology components from multiple vendors. Furthermore, with every new service provider added to the partnership, the number of integrations and complexity increases exponentially. These integrations are expensive to build, onerous to maintain and error prone. Before long, a service provider has a metaphorical janitor-sized ring of integration \xe2\x80\x9ckeys\xe2\x80\x9d they have to manage. The stakes are high if service providers don\xe2\x80\x99t staff up to manage this integration work. eSIM hand-offs can fail, creating costly delays and a sub-optimal experience for customers. Service providers have accepted this integration cost as a painful part of doing business \xe2\x80\x93 until now.\nHow Cisco can help: eSIM Flex\nFiguring out the eSIM problem is important to Cisco \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco IoT Control Center manages the most connected car SIMs in the world. Our 50+ service provider partners rely on us to help them service these important relationships. With insights from our customers, Cisco decided to turn the approach to eSIM on its head with our new eSIM Flex service. We\xe2\x80\x99ve created a cloud-based solution that harnesses technology and innovation instead of manpower to enable multi-carrier global partnerships for true global connectivity. We are the first in the market to offer all the benefits of eSIM without the integration costs or headaches.\nThis innovation means service providers can delight unlimited global manufacturing customers with one single solution instead of a rapidly growing integration support staff. With eSIM Flex, service providers integrate just once, and they are automatically enabled for partnerships with all other service providers without any additional integrations. For example, for a global partnership between five service providers, traditional eSIM solutions would require setting up and maintaining 55 integrations. The same partnership with our eSIM Flex solution requires only five integrations. All partnerships between operators are easily configured in the cloud and can be defined at a per customer level so that service providers get the flexibility without compromising on control. All eSIM services are offered in a user-friendly cloud portal as well as powerful APIs to integrate with global manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s supply chain systems. eSIM Flex simplifies eSIM technology for both service providers and enterprise customers, so they can effectively meet growing global business demand.\nCisco helps our partners push the envelope to meet the changing business needs of their customers. IoT device growth projections are on the rise \xe2\x80\x93 we will see more connected cars, meters, heavy equipment, and robots. We predict the global manufacturing community will demand simple cellular connectivity solutions en masse and we want our service providers to scale cost effectively. eSIM Flex is part of our solution.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to open the next wave of trials for customers interested in these issues.\nSign up to join the  Cisco IoT Control Center eSIM Flex trials.\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT Control Center eSIM Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing SIM Transportation,"June 24, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1536255975-bpfull.jpg
134,Securing industrial IoT: the missing piece to the puzzle,Fabien Maisl,"b'When industrial organizations connect their operational environment to the network as part of their IoT initiatives, their technology landscape grows. However, much like a puzzle, organizations often find there\xe2\x80\x99s a missing piece that\xe2\x80\x99s preventing anyone from seeing the full picture of this new landscape. Without that missing piece, the entire landscape is at risk.\nSecurity Operations Centers (SOCs) and IT security teams use technology platforms to gain visibility into the IT environment, monitor traffic, and respond to malicious behaviors. Unfortunately, those platforms don\xe2\x80\x99t provide the same capabilities for the operational technology (OT) environment. The solutions don\xe2\x80\x99t understand OT protocols, and therefore can\xe2\x80\x99t provide the critical visibility needed to understand what devices are on the network, the messages being sent, and whether or not those communications are malicious.\nSecurity teams are thus missing information that is critical for building OT security policies. For example, because of the interdependency of the OT environment, quarantining an infected device can cause an entire production process to come to a halt. Security teams need visibility of industrial assets and industrial processes, and this information must feed into IT security tools so that security experts and platforms can understand the OT environment, identify suspicious activity, and take the proper measures to investigate and remediate qualified threats\xe2\x80\x94without breaking the production process.\nAll of this is possible with Cisco Cyber Vision. Designed to help industrial organizations gain visibility of their industrial assets and processes to detect threats and anomalies and extend IT security to the OT domain, the 3.1 release further extends integration with the rest of the Cisco portfolio and offers an entirely updated anomaly detection engine to spot abnormal process behaviors that could be the early signs of attacks to industrial control systems. Cyber Vision 3.1 was released at the end of May and includes:\nNew Cyber Vision edge integrations \xe2\x80\x94 The Cyber Vision Sensor software can now run within select Cisco network equipment (Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged, Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series, and Cisco Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches), eliminating the need for dedicated appliances and SPAN collection networks to monitor industrial networks. Network managers will appreciate the unique simplicity and the lower costs of this edge architecture when looking to deploy OT security at scale.\nNew Cyber Vision security integrations \xe2\x80\x94 The Cyber Vision Center now integrates with Cisco Threat Response, in addition to existing integrations with Cisco ISE, Stealthwatch, FMC, and DNA-C. The new integration with CTR makes it very simple to investigate assets or any observable identified in Cyber Vision by leveraging intelligence gathered by other Cisco Security products.\nUpdated anomaly detection engine \xe2\x80\x94 Cisco Cyber Vision now includes Talos subscription rule sets to detect intrusions and malicious traffic based on the latest signatures developed by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group. It also offers an updated anomaly detection engine that lets users baseline normal behaviors of the industrial networks to trigger alert on deviations. Numerous baselines can be created to monitor specific parts of the network or specific types of behaviors making it a very powerful solution to detect process anomalies and track remote accesses or custom attacks.\nCisco Cyber Vision is the missing piece to the puzzle that brings the OT environment into focus. It leverages the existing industrial network to collect security information and apply threat detection techniques that are relevant to industrial operations. Comprehensive integrations with legacy security tools makes all this data available for IT teams to build converged security operations.\nCisco Cyber Vision not only delivers the visibility security teams need to protect and secure the OT landscape, it does so in a way that reduces the cost and complexity traditionally associated with monitoring a connected environment.

135,"New innovations for more connected devices, performance, and power at the IoT edge",Vikas Butaney,"b'In recent months organizations across industries have been and continue to re-evaluate their business resiliency, preparedness for remote operations, agility to handle changes in production, supply chains, and like Cisco WebEx \xe2\x80\x93 explosive demand. Businesses are looking beyond the current situation to prepare for any future shocks. One thing is clear, having a secure, always-on digital enterprise is foundational to business resiliency and continuity.\nFor example, if you are an energy company connecting remote assets such as substations, you need to gain the intelligence needed to make distribution automation projects successful. Cities are going \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d connecting everything from intersections to improve pedestrian safety, pipelines to detect water leaks, and providing real-time parking data so citizens are not wasting time looking for a spot, as the city of Caldas da Rainha in Portugal did. Ultimately, organizations must be prepared with a secure, reliable communication infrastructure which is ready to handle edge processing requirements. IT will become even more important to help get businesses ready for this new world.\nToday, Cisco IoT is announcing three new innovations to securely connect and scale your remote operations bringing real-time and bandwidth heavy IoT applications to fruition \xe2\x80\x93 anywhere \xe2\x80\x93 with the security and simplicity to scale with existing IT capabilities.\nHigher performance, power and cybersecurity at the IoT edge\nAdding on to our robust Industrial Ethernet (IE) switching portfolio, we are excited to announce new 10 Gigabit Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series Switches. These switches extend the benefits of intent-based networking to the IoT edge to help secure, automate and manage your deployments at scale, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s connecting video cameras on roadways, improving pedestrian safety in intersections, or monitoring quality on the plant floor. The new 10G uplinks and 2.5 Gbps downlinks allow organizations to create better user experiences via Wi-Fi 6 or 802.11ac Wave 2 applications. The new switch has 90W power over ethernet (PoE) ports to connect more devices. With this power and speed, you can connect more than 100 4K cameras in a ring topology.\nWith cybersecurity being top of mind for IT and operational users alike, the new switches support Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT security architecture including Cisco Cyber Vision, providing the visibility, operational insights, and protection against cybersecurity threats in operational environments. These new switch capabilities will allow organizations to transform their network cost effectively \xe2\x80\x93 without replacing their cabling infrastructure or installing new electrical circuits to power devices.\nFor example, Quanergy, a Cisco partner that provides Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is already seeing opportunities for the new switches for processing LiDAR sensor data.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn smart city deployments, it is necessary to aggregate and process data from multiple LiDAR sensors installed at intersections and roadways to create business intelligence for traffic management. The 10G capability of the Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series Switches will provide higher bandwidth switching capacity and scalability needed to better assist with processing data from Quanergy\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensors for these large-scale city-wide deployments, ultimately helping cities gain insights of their data in real-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94Enzo Signore, CMO, Quanergy.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be sharing more on these new switches and their capabilities next week at digital Cisco Live.\nReliable communications for critical infrastructure and remote assets\nToday, we are also excited to announce that our IR1101 Integrated Services Router can now enable critical infrastructure and first responders with secure, reliable and uninterrupted connectivity so that they can access information over a dedicated LTE band. We are finalizing FirstNet certification, for cities, roadways and public sector customers to have a dedicated network for any emergency in the future.\nWe are announcing two new LTE modules for investment protection and flexibility of the IR1101 at the IoT Edge. The new Cisco LTE module supports Category 18, Private-LTE and CBRS giving you high performance and the new Cisco LTE Category 4 module. Both provide an ultra-reliable connection to the public safety spectrum. The new modules combined with the IR1101 router can also enable organizations with remote and distributed environments, including cities, utilities, and oil & gas so they can support twice the amount of data. This additional capacity allows organizations to use the LTE network to extend their wireless access network (WAN) anywhere \xe2\x80\x93 while also allowing them to have the speed and capacity to support bandwidth heavy, real-time applications where they need them.\nStay tuned for more on this next week at digital Cisco Live!\nResilient wireless backhaul for on-the-move assets\nRemote and autonomous operations are even more important for ports, mines, plants, and transportation systems with the focus on business resiliency. With the recent announcement of our intent to acquire Fluidmesh, we look forward to being able to provide reliable wireless communication to the most challenging environments, whether that is a high-speed train traveling at 300Km/h, or large dense areas that face signal impedance such as shipping ports, mines and cities.\nDuring our Cisco Live event, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking more to the future opportunities around Fluidmesh and how Fluidmesh technology will further strengthen the Cisco IoT portfolio.\nWhile every organization, partner, and executive are evaluating major changes in their businesses (and personal life), one thing is clear: secure, robust communication networks will be critical to improved uptime and business resiliency plans moving forward. Cisco IoT is continuing the investments to help you prepare, and these solutions are a way to help you on your digital journey and establish resiliency by connecting what matters most to your business.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t emphasize enough what an important time it is for Cisco IoT.

136,"A recipe for industrial security: A dash of IT, a pinch of OT, and a sprinkle of SOC",Marc Blackmer,"b'I like to cook. And if you enjoy it, too, you know that sharing the kitchen can bring a set of challenges. The more cooks there are in the kitchen, the more things can become contentious. But, if one person works on an appetizer, another on the main course, and a third on dessert, the result is often five stars. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re like me, everything tends to become a metaphor for work. So, this scenario got me thinking about how the primary stakeholders in securing industrial IoT (or, IIoT) are like cooks in the kitchen. Each has his or her set of priorities, and when they work together, the better the chance of a great meal, err, I mean, result.\nThe chefs\nThere are usually three vested chefs, or stakeholders, in an OT security effort. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with OT itself. OT is responsible for ensuring that industrial processes keep running. These processes are meant to be static and predictable. OT\xe2\x80\x99s objective is to reduce downtime with operational insights that help track activities in the industrial process. OT wants more efficiency, more predictability, and more scalability. To achieve these things, the network must be secure, and OT requires visibility to better understand what\xe2\x80\x99s on the network and how devices are operating.\nThe second party with a vested interest in OT security is the IT department. IT is responsible for implementing and managing the security infrastructure. A traditional security solution requires security appliances deployed throughout the environment, an ever-growing SPAN collection network, or a combination of the two. With these types of solutions, the total cost of ownership (TCO) increases as the environment grows. Not only does the organization need to invest in more appliances and an out-of-band collection network to support the additional SPAN traffic, but it also incurs operational costs. IT simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the resources to support a sprawling security infrastructure in the OT environment in addition to the IT environment.\nMeanwhile, the security operation center\xe2\x80\x99s (SOC) number one priority is to protect the business against threats using the strongest suite of industrial application-aware integrated security solutions. The SOC wants visibility into the OT environment so that it can see the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities as they relate to the whole organization. This context is critical to understanding how to write security policies to best protect those assets. In an IT environment, best practice dictates quarantining a compromised asset to prevent an attack from spreading through the network. This same approach in an OT environment can cause an entire process to come to a grinding halt due to the interdependency of the systems.\nThe recipe\nTo successfully secure the OT environment, all three vested parties must work together like ingredients in a recipe. Each party possesses institutional knowledge that is required for the other to achieve their objectives: OT understands the industrial environment \xe2\x80\x94 the devices, the protocols, and the business processes, IT understands the IP network, and the SOC understands threats and vulnerabilities. Together, these three entities can form a powerful defense against attackers.\nThe OT environment must be protected to ensure high availability and reliability, but the SOC must understand the context of the devices in order to apply the right security policies. In order to do either of those things, both must have visibility into the OT environment \xe2\x80\x94 visibility provided by a security solution with an architecture that reduces the TCO for IT.\nHow Cisco can help\nCisco Cyber Vision is an integrated industrial security solution. Cyber Vision uses a two-tier architecture consisting of a central appliance and sensors embedded in the networking hardware. The sensors perform deep-packet inspection (DPI) on industrial-grade switches to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the network and to forward metadata to the data center. Because the sensors are in every network switch, OT and the SOC benefit from full network visibility. Through Cisco Cyber Vision, OT and the SOC can see the brand and make of the assets on the network, how they are communicating, and what they are communicating to. In addition to a detailed OT asset inventory, Cyber Vision tracks industrial processes. The embedded sensors can provide analytical insights into every component of industrial control systems \xe2\x80\x94giving OT a greater level insight than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before.\nBecause Cyber Vision\xe2\x80\x99s software-based sensors run in a container on the network devices,  there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to send people out to implement appliances or build a separate out-of-band network to handle the additional traffic. IT simply has to turn on the sensor functionality, which has no impact on performance, a further benefit to OT. This unique edge architecture reduces complexity and the TCO of securing the OT environment, even as it enables scalability.\nFor the SOC, Cisco Cyber Vision detects attempts to modify assets and provides cyber threat detection powered by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group, a leading-edge cyber threat intelligence team. Cyber Vision\xe2\x80\x99s integration with security systems enables SOCs to monitor, investigate, and remediate threats across operational departments \xe2\x80\x94 all from a single solution. The SOC can reduce time spent on investigations with common aggregated threat intelligence and protect industrial processes with macro- and micro-segmentation built into the industrial network.\nCisco Cyber Vision helps all three parties \xe2\x80\x94 OT, IT, and the SOC \xe2\x80\x94 achieve their goal: the ability to secure and improve the availability of the OT environment with a scalable, low-TCO solution.

137,Cisco IoT sneak preview: what to watch for at digital Cisco Live June 16-17,Patty Medberry,"b'The impact that IoT can have on an organization can be staggering. Yesterday, I talked to a manufacturing company that improved its production uptime by 13 percent \xe2\x80\x93 saving them millions, as a single day of shutdown results in $9 million of lost profits. Organizations across industries are executing on their digitization strategies to stay competitive and to maintain business continuity in these turbulent times. In fact, these successes will drive IoT devices to account for 50 percent of all network devices by 2023. At Cisco Live, taking place for free online June 16 and 17, you will hear how we are enabling new business-impacting IoT use cases and using the network to enable them. Let me give you a preview.\nInnovative, business impacting use cases are everywhere\nMore than ever, we are seeing a wider variety of use cases requiring data to be used instantly and at mass. Examples of these include:\nWarehouses, distribution center and manufacturing facilities using automation to drive efficiency. Technologies such as autonomous guided vehicles can be used as material handling systems or load carriers traveling throughout the facility without an onboard driver.\nSurveillance and manufacturing use cases using 4K and 8K video to improve public safety and quality of production\nManaging crowds using 3D sensors or using thermal imaging to monitor employee health as they enter a building\nCommunicating with high-speed trains to continuously monitor systems, location, track cargo, and provide onboard Wi-Fi to passengers\nAt Cisco live, we will cover these as well as other types of use case that can drive real results across your organization.\nIs your network ready for IoT?\nMany networks today were not designed for the capacity or speed required for some IoT use cases. Next-generation wireless technologies and their bandwidth heavy applications, for example, exceed the traditional capacity of wired infrastructure. The network must handle higher speeds and bandwidth both upstream and downstream or your users and their applications will not get the data needed to make business decisions in a timely fashion.\nAnother consideration is security. The number of connected devices drastically expands the threat surface, putting organizations at risk. Organizations need an accurate inventory of what assets are connected, a baseline of communication patterns for these assets, and anomaly detection for OT environments to secure any IoT deployment.\nFinally, the number of connected devices far exceeds the growth of IT resources. Managing these devices and keeping the network up to date is overwhelming and expensive. And while next-generation wireless technologies are hailed as the answer for everything, that is simply not the case. Organizations will increase the types of access technologies they manage, because the best access technology depends on the use case. More than ever, IT needs a way to automate tasks, simplify the network and reduce the potential for rip and replace.\nAt Cisco Live, you will learn about how our new innovations will enable the network to better support real-time and bandwidth-heavy use cases with the simplicity you need. We will cover how Cisco, unlike any other vendor on the market, is helping secure networks throughout the enterprise all the way to OT, operational environment with Cisco Cyber Vision. Finally, you will hear more about our intent to acquire Fluidmesh enabling resilient wireless backhaul with zero packet loss \xe2\x80\x93 perfect for connecting anything moving at high speeds.\nThese and other topics will be discussed virtually.

138,The four-step journey to securing the industrial network,Marc Blackmer,"b'Just as the digitization and increasing connectivity of business processes has enlarged the attack surface of the IT environment, so too has the digitization and increasing connectivity of industrial processes broadened the attack surface for industrial control networks. Though they share this security risk profile, the operational technology (OT) environment is very different from that of IT. This post looks at the key differences and provides a four-step approach to securing the industrial network.\nIn industries like utilities, manufacturing, and transportation, the operations side of the business is revenue generating. As a result, uptime is critical. While uptime is important in IT, interdependencies in the OT environment make it challenging to maintain uptime while addressing security threats. For example, you can\xe2\x80\x99t simply isolate an endpoint that\xe2\x80\x99s sending anomalous traffic. Because of the interdependencies of that endpoint, isolating it can have a cascading effect that brings a critical business process to a grinding halt. Or, worse, human lives may be put at risk. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the context of security events so that they can be addressed while maintaining uptime.\nWith uptime requirements in mind, securing the industrial network can feel like an insurmountable challenge. Many industrial organizations don\xe2\x80\x99t have visibility into all of the devices that are on their OT networks, let alone the dependencies among them. Devices have been added over time, often by third-party contractors, and an asset inventory is either non-existent or grossly outdated. Bottom line: organizations lack visibility into the operational technology environment.\nTo help industrial organizations address these challenges and effectively secure the OT environment, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put together a four-step journey to securing the industrial network. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that while we call it a journey, there is no defined beginning or end. It\xe2\x80\x99s an iterative process that requires continual adjustments. The most important thing is to start wherever you happen to be today.\nThere are many places from which to begin, and what makes a logical first step for one organization will not necessarily be the same for another. One approach is to start with gaining visibility through asset discovery. By analyzing network traffic, deep packet inspection (DPI) can identify the industrial assets connected to your network.  With this visibility, you can make an informed decision on the best way to segment the network to limit the spread of an attack.\nIn addition to identifying assets, DPI identifies which assets are communicating, with whom or what they are communicating, and what they are communicating. With this baseline established, you can detect anomalous behavior and potential threats that may threaten process integrity. This information can then be fed into a unified security operations center (SOC), providing complete visibility to the security team.\nHow you deploy DPI is important. Embedding a DPI-enabled sensor on switches saves hardware costs and physical space, which can be at a premium, depending on the industry. DPI-enabled sensors allow you to inspect traffic without encountering deployment, scalability, bandwidth, or maintenance hurdles. Because switches see all network traffic, embedded sensors can provide the visibility you need to segment the network and detect threats early on. The solution can also integrate with the IT SOC while providing analytical insights into every component of the industrial control system. With DPI-enabled network switches, industrial organizations can more easily move through the four-step journey to securing the industrial network.\nMy colleague and I took a deep dive into DPI-enabled network switches in a recent webcast, Extending Cybersecurity to the OT/Industrial Domain. I encourage you to view the on-demand webcast to learn more about this technology and Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity offering designed specifically for industrial IoT.\nShare'",Tags: assets Cybersecurity deep packet inspection Internet of Things (IoT) IT networking security Segmentation threat detection,"May 7, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1476199550-bpfull.jpg
139,How edgy should your edge compute be?,Mirko Grabel,"b'Here at Cisco, we consider edge computing to mean that data is processed before it crosses any wide area network (WAN). Crossing the WAN\xe2\x80\x94whether to send data to a traditional data center on-prem or in the cloud\xe2\x80\x94introduces latency and incurs additional costs, both of which edge computing is intended to avoid. That being said, there is still flexibility in terms of where you establish the edge \xe2\x80\x93 AKA how \xe2\x80\x9cedgy\xe2\x80\x9d your edge compute is. As with most technologies, the best choice is relative to your use case, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll explore below.\nThere are two questions to ask when determining how edgy you want your edge computing to be:\nNo. 1\xe2\x80\x94Where is data most useful?\nThe first criteria for determining where to put edge compute is based on the use case itself. Consider: where will data be the most useful? Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s more beneficial to have the data closer to the edge, and other times it\xe2\x80\x99s more important to centralize and aggregate the data. For example, security systems such as those in a connected car, need to take action at the edge, and in real-time. It makes more sense, therefore, to keep compute at the edge. Administrative and predictive applications, alternatively, are more useful when data is aggregated. In that case, the data benefits from being centralized.\nWhile the usefulness of the data is critical, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only consideration.\nNo. 2\xe2\x80\x94Is it worth the cost?\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a cost trade-off when you put compute at the edge. The further to the edge you go, the lower the cost of transporting the data BUT the higher the compute costs.\nLet me explain this with an example. Consider a video camera deployment. You have two options:\n1) You deploy a fleet of cheap video cameras on a simple network and do all your compute in the cloud, where you have access to advanced services and cost-efficient hardware. Your compute costs will be low, but your transportation costs will be high because you need to backhaul all of your data to the cloud services provider.\n2) You deploy a fleet of very expensive cameras with compute on or very near them (that is, at the edge). Whether you choose to purchase intelligent cameras with machine learning integrated or an appliance that does the machine learning, your compute costs will be high and your backhaul costs will be low.\nUnfortunately, even in the video camera use case, the answer isn\xe2\x80\x99t as clear as you\xe2\x80\x99d hope. If a Department of Transportation deploys cameras for wrong driver detection, myriad factors come into play that impact the cost. Considerations include:\nDistance between intersections\nIf a high-speed connection is available\nIf the resources are available to maintain and upgrade the system\nAll these factors need to be carefully weighed in a cost/benefit analysis.\nBy definition, edge computing reduces latency and data transportation costs\xe2\x80\x94but those benefits come at a cost. As you determine how edgy your edge computing should be, consider where your data delivers the most value and weigh that value against the costs incurred. If you need a deeper dive into edge computing, check out my blog post on IoT benefits and use cases.\nShare'",Tags: backhaul cloud data edge compute Internet of Things (IoT) WAN,"April 23, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1572904361-bpfull.jpg
140,Using tech for good: How Cisco IoT is keeping rhinos safe,Laurent Andriantsiferana,"b'Imagine deploying an internet of things (IoT) solution to track mobile assets, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no internet access, no cellular connectivity and no power. The landscape is hilly with rocky outcrops, and, to make things even more interesting, you\xe2\x80\x99re installing towers surrounded by wild lion prides and herds of buffalo. No sweat, right? But that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing compared to the threats your assets face. Because the mobile assets you\xe2\x80\x99re tracking? They\xe2\x80\x99re rhinos.\nRhinoceros poaching is a severe problem in Africa. Each day, for the last five years, three African rhinos have been poached. Overall, two-thirds of the world\xe2\x80\x99s five rhino species could be lost in our lifetime.\nThis is a shocking reality that Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Sustainable Impact program is working to change. As part of the Emerging Technologies and Incubation organization, this Tech for Good initiative combines engineering and innovation to solve some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging problems.\nCisco is proud to be a part of a consortium of technology and conservation experts working with Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife to protect the world\xe2\x80\x99s second largest wild rhino population in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park. We had the unique opportunity to partner with Peace Parks Foundation and NIL Data Communications to help deploy a Cisco networking solution, based on LoRaWAN\xe2\x84\xa2.\nThe LoRaWAN technology provides a unique geolocation solution for low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs), enabling a wide range of applications requiring location determination for battery-powered devices. The Cisco Solution for LoRaWAN offers a fully integrated and functional infrastructure that includes a ruggedized gateway for LoRa radio access, a gateway IP management system, and a centralized controller for radio management of the gateways and end devices as well as geolocation management.\nThe Cisco LoRaWAN solution is typically deployed in urban environments. Given the unique constraints of the South African bush, we designed and developed a custom network for the park, which spans 960 square kilometers. It was an incredibly challenging \xe2\x80\x94 but equally rewarding \xe2\x80\x94 experience.\nBefore installing 25 towers across the park, we conducted advanced predictive RF simulation to determine the best locations for the LoRaWAN gateway. We needed an advanced RF design to cover the entire park and enable the best geolocalization. All of the equipment had to be ruggedized to protect it from animals and poachers and be completely autonomous of power. The solution also needed to be robust and reliable because the reserve doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of an IT staff. The system combines several technologies, including LoRaWAN, edge computing, Wi-Fi, cellular, point-to-multipoint RF link, solar panels, and batteries, and has become a generic multi-service platform that can be used in any park.\nAs a result of our efforts, the low-power, long-range technology can track sensors throughout the reserve, enabling rangers to locate rhinos and detect if poachers are present. The network is designed to be resilient and redundant with failover systems.\nThe integration of IoT and edge computing, with a smart Cisco network of tactically implemented sensors and systems, is changing the way in which critical natural resources and ecosystems are protected. But this is just the beginning \xe2\x80\x94 the rhino conservation project shows that you can bring the power of IoT to the most highly constrained environments, proving that there are no limits to what you can do with this technology.\nTo learn more about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s conservation work, and the Sustainable Impact program, check out our feature story, our first-look blog, and our symposium blog.\n  Share'",Tags: africa geolocation Internet of Things (IoT) LoRaWAN Rhinos wildlife,"April 21, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220606110445-Laurent-Andriantsiferana-150x150.jpg
141,Optimizing manufacturing’s new output: data,Vernon Turner,"b'Digital-first enterprises deliver eight times more revenue growth and twice as much profit margin than their peers. It\xe2\x80\x99s true in retail. It\xe2\x80\x99s true in banking. And it\xe2\x80\x99s true in manufacturing \xe2\x80\x93 the focus of this blog post.\nMy friend and former colleague, IDC analyst Frank Gens, shared those insights in Preparing for the Digital-First Economy: The Hyperscale, Hyperspeed, and Hyperconnected Enterprise, published as part of IDC Directions 2020. His report underscores the tremendous opportunity facing manufacturers that invest in digital technologies, including IoT. And no matter what a manufacturer makes today, when it transforms into a digital factory, it will generate a critical new output: massive quantities of data.\nAs information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) converge, IoT sensors and devices will produce a mind-boggling amount of information. That information can help transform legacy assets into digital assets. It also makes it possible to unleash new opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 including the application of machine learning and digital twins, and their integration into digital supply chains.\nIn a recent webinar, I outlined 10 requirements or considerations to increase OT business value from IoT data. In addition, all digital factories will need to manage their data effectively \xe2\x80\x93 and that requires attention to three key elements:\n1. Governance. The data flowing within a digital factory and across ecosystem partners contains a company\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual property (IP) and competitive differentiation. It must be managed accordingly. Manufacturers need clear answers to these and other questions: What data is needed? Who gets to see it? What are users permitted to do with their data? And, how will they be held accountable?\n2. Security. On a factory floor, security converges around two dimensions: physical security of OT and cybersecurity of IT. Every digital factory must have full visibility of OT and IT assets and how data is moving among them. There can be no compromise on security \xe2\x80\x93 period!\n3. Connectivity. Factories typically run inside condensed spaces, and network connectivity has been viewed like any other utility. It\xe2\x80\x99s always there when needed, but how it is managed has little importance. However, once IoT solutions are deployed, factories must be able to capture data at the network edge and potentially pass it into a multi-cloud environment (including private cloud, public cloud, on premise and off premise). The notion of sending data to the cloud can be frightening \xe2\x80\x93 which is why secure connectivity is so important.\nManufacturing is at the cusp of a transformation created by the availability of asset data. OT managers increasingly feel pressure to promote the use of factory data to build better products or better services. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s OT\xe2\x80\x99s charter to safeguard the factory floor, IT suppliers must address the three pillars of data management \xe2\x80\x93 governance, security and connectivity \xe2\x80\x93 to power digital success.\nWhether building automobiles or airplanes, blending batter or producing prescription drugs, every manufacturer benefits from simple, powerful tools for becoming a digital factory \xe2\x80\x93 without compromising the business.\nShare'",Tags: connectivity data Governance Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing OT security,"April 16, 2020",https://alln-extcloud-storage.cisco.com/Cisco_Blogs:blogs/1/2020/02/IL20200203213922-Vernon-Turner-scaled-150x150.jpg
142,Edge computing: Benefits and IoT use cases,Mirko Grabel,"b'Edge computing brings a number of benefits to the Internet of Things. Reduced latency, improved resiliency and availability, lower costs, and local data storage (to assist with regulatory compliance) to name a few. In my last blog post I examined some of these benefits as a means of defining exactly where is the edge. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at how edge computing benefits play out in real-world IoT use cases.\nBenefit No. 1: Reduced latency\nMany applications have strict latency requirements, but when it comes to safety and security applications, latency can be a matter of life or death. Consider, for example, an autonomous vehicle applying brakes or roadside signs warning drivers of upcoming hazards. By the time data is sent to the cloud and analyzed, and a response is returned to the car or sign, lives can be endangered. But let\xe2\x80\x99s crunch some numbers just for fun.\nSay a Department of Transportation in Florida is considering a cloud service to host the apps for its roadside signs. One of the vendors on the DoT\xe2\x80\x99s shortlist is a cloud in California. The DoT\xe2\x80\x99s latency requirement is less than 15ms. The light speed in fiber is about 5 \xce\xbcs/km. The distance from the U.S. east coast to the west coast is about 5,000 km. Do the math and the resulting round-trip latency is 50ms. It\xe2\x80\x99s pure physics. If the DoT requires a real-time response, it must move the compute closer to the devices.\nBenefit No. 2: Improved resiliency/availability\nCritical infrastructure requires the highest level of availability and resiliency to ensure safety and continuity of services. Consider a refinery gas leakage detection system. It must be able to operate without Internet access. If the system goes offline and there\xe2\x80\x99s a leakage, that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue. Compute must be done at the edge. In this case, the edge may be on the system itself.\nWhile it\xe2\x80\x99s not a life-threatening use case, retail operations can also benefit from the availability provided by edge compute. Retailers want their Point of Sale (PoS) systems to be available 100% of the time to service customers. But some retail stores are in remote locations with unreliable WAN connections. Moving the PoS systems onto their edge compute enables retailers to maintain high availability.\nBenefit No. 3: Reduced costs\nBandwidth is almost infinite, but it comes at a cost. Edge computing allows organizations to reduce bandwidth costs by processing data before it crosses the WAN. This benefit applies to any use case, but here are two example use-cases where this is very evident: video surveillance and preventive maintenance. For example, a single city-deployed HD video camera may generate 1,296GB a month. Streaming that data over LTE easily becomes cost prohibitive. Adding edge compute to pre-aggregate the data significantly reduces those costs.\nManufacturers use edge computing for preventive maintenance of remote machinery. Sensors are used to monitor temperatures and vibrations. The currency of this data is critical, as the slightest variation can indicate a problem. To ensure that issues are caught as early as possible, the application requires high-resolution data (for example, 1000 per second). Rather than sending all of this data over the Internet to be analyzed, edge compute is used to filter the data and only averages, anomalies and threshold violations are sent to the cloud.\nBenefit No. 4: Comply with government regulations\nCountries are increasingly instituting privacy and data retention laws. The European Union\xe2\x80\x99s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a prime example. Any organization that has data belonging to an EU citizen is required to meet the GDPR\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, which includes an obligation to report leaks of personal data. Edge computing can help these organizations comply with GDPR. For example, instead of storing and backhauling surveillance video, a smart city can evaluate the footage at the edge and only backhaul the meta data.\nCanada\xe2\x80\x99s Water Act: National Hydrometric Program is another edge computing use case that delivers regulatory compliance benefits. As part of the program, about 3,000 measurement stations have been implemented nationwide. Any missing data requires justification. However, storing data at the edge ensures data retention.\nBonus Benefit: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I want to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nFinally, some users simply prefer to have full control. By implementing compute at the edge rather than the cloud, users have greater flexibility. We have seen this in manufacturing. Technicians want to have full control over the machinery. Edge computing gives them this control as well as independence from IT. The technicians know the machinery best and security and availability remain top of mind.\nSummary\nBy reducing latency and costs, improving resiliency and availability, and keeping data local, edge computing opens up a new world of IoT use cases. Those described here are just the beginning. It will be exciting to see where we see edge computing turn up next.

143,IoT: Quench the thirst for smart water management,Vernon Turner,"b'Water is one of our most precious resources. Yet every year, we lose more than 126 million cubic meters globally to leaks, poor metering and theft. Beyond that is the energy wasted moving water that never gets used. It adds up to staggering economic \xe2\x80\x93 and environmental \xe2\x80\x93 costs.\nIt also presents one of the most compelling opportunities to use industrial IoT solutions.\nWater utilities can use IoT to address two fundamental aspects of water management: maintaining the physical infrastructure and addressing water safety and sustainability. With IoT sensors throughout a water utility\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, it becomes possible to:\nmeasure water levels in real time and gather data for longer-term consumption analysis\nproactively detect leaks in the pipes\nmonitor health and safety metrics, including levels of chemicals and contaminants\nplan for future infrastructure requirements and consumption\nIn many ways, these uses mirror what\xe2\x80\x99s possible in manufacturing. But while factory floors are condensed environments \xe2\x80\x93 with all assets located in a confined area \xe2\x80\x93 water utilities operate highly distributed environments. Reservoirs, pipes, pumps and other assets are spread across a massive physical footprint. Such environments introduce some unique challenges.\nOne of the most pressing is cost. Capturing data across a massive infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 and moving it to the enterprise and/or cloud \xe2\x80\x93 is a heavy lift. That\xe2\x80\x99s especially true when considering the criticality of timely transmission and analysis of water data. Any delay can contribute to continued losses.\nSo, how can water utilities support the network and compute load that\xe2\x80\x99s required for effective IoT solutions without overloading the cost structure?\nThe answer is to embed intelligence at the point of collection. Rather than having to capture and then move data, utilities can analyze it and provide actionable insights at the network edge. Utilities could establish clear policies to trigger appropriate responses \xe2\x80\x93 for example, to shut off a valve when a reservoir level falls below a certain threshold or to alert when flow capacity is off, suggesting the presence of a leakage that should be addressed. To better understand what are the important decisions that make up a long lasting Edge Computing infrastructure can be found here.\nA well-designed industrial IoT network can deliver around-the-clock, in-depth insights across tens of thousands of miles of water infrastructure. And it can do so affordably with edge intelligence. These capabilities are invaluable not only to well-established utilities looking to \xe2\x80\x9creplace the pipe\xe2\x80\x9d but also in emerging economies that are working to forecast future demand.\nSpeaking of the future, McKinsey has predicted that by 2030, global demand for water will outpace viable resources by 40 percent. Now is the time to take decisive action to improve how we manage this finite natural resource. There has never been a better time to deploy an intelligent-rich water network that can be simple to deploy, manage and report while meeting the needs of customers, operational staff and IT services.\nLearn more about Cisco Edge Intelligence and our work with water utilities around the globe.

144,From outside-in to inside-out: My take on IoT,Vernon Turner,"b'At IDC I co-founded a practice that studied the three dimensions of IoT: industry technology platforms, industry verticals and industry geographies. As an industry analyst, I had a front-row ticket to the IoT market and continually witnessed incredible innovations. Like many other experts, I kept my seatbelt buckled for what we expected to be IoT\xe2\x80\x99s massive and dramatic take-off.\nWhile there has been uptake, real-world adoption and implementation have lagged the \xe2\x80\x9chype.\xe2\x80\x9d In time, I found myself growing increasingly frustrated at the disconnect. What was the holdup? Knowing that industry analysts are beholden to the marketing messages that each company shares, I welcomed an opportunity to make the move from an outside-in analyst to an inside-out contributor.\nI wanted the chance to be involved in bringing a product to market, putting it in the customer\xe2\x80\x99s hands and getting to the \xe2\x80\x9cother side\xe2\x80\x9d of the story. Now four months into my role as a product marketing manager within Cisco IoT, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the chance to do just that. Along the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m exploring some important questions: Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t IoT markets taken off as quickly as predicted? What are the inhibitors? Is it customer awareness? Customer readiness? Market maturity? Concerns about security or data ownership?\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s some of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned so far:\nIt takes two \xe2\x80\x93 OT and IT \xe2\x80\x93 to tango. IoT solutions are designed for use in the field \xe2\x80\x93 whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a factory floor, an oil field or a sprawling power or water treatment plant. The teams who oversee these infrastructures and the supporting operational technology (OT) aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same people who manage information technology (IT). While OT users are the ones who will want to purchase and use IoT solutions, IT stakeholders are the ones who can help deliver the scale and cybersecurity to make a project a success. Too often, these stakeholders haven\xe2\x80\x99t received the messages that matter to them. Bridging this gap \xe2\x80\x93 with product capabilities that meet the needs of both audiences \xe2\x80\x93 represents an important opportunity for us at Cisco.\nImplementation sounds scary. Most environments have a diverse and complex set of systems and protocols. The thought of integrating IoT devices is enough to give any IT or OT professional a headache. Yet this is where Cisco really shines, as our industrial networking products integrate with many protocols and are surrounded by a suite of capabilities that enable seamless onboarding of IoT devices regardless of where a customer is or what systems that customer is running. Among these tools: Cisco Validated Designs, Cisco Kinetic Gateway Management Module and Cisco DNA Center.\nData management is daunting, too. In IDC Directions 2020, analyst Ashish Nadkarni predicts that 70 percent of all enterprise data will be processed at the edge of the network by 2023. It\xe2\x80\x99s the next big trend in IoT and it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that it may be a perceived barrier. After all, processing data at the edge \xe2\x80\x93 and/or moving some of it from the edge to the cloud \xe2\x80\x93 is a complicated proposition for anyone. Again, Cisco excels in this area with our Edge Intelligence capabilities and integrations with Microsoft Azure and other cloud providers. We have bookended the complicated data flow and made it simpler for organizations to get started in IoT \xe2\x80\x93 and realize the benefits of the data that these solutions generate.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing feeling of \xe2\x80\x9cinsecurity.\xe2\x80\x9d Organizations are rightfully concerned about connecting IoT devices. After all, if not secured properly, these devices could provide unauthorized access to \xe2\x80\x9ccrown jewel\xe2\x80\x9d SCADA systems in a utility or to PLCs on a factory floor, among others. Risks related to stolen intellectual property, worker safety and productivity cannot be ignored. Fortunately, there is a way to secure IoT solutions \xe2\x80\x93 at scale and with simplicity \xe2\x80\x93 with Cisco Cyber Vision. Cyber Vision offers security in a way that meets the needs of IT and OT.\nMy \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d role is helping me better understand and lift the barriers \xe2\x80\x93 real and perceived \xe2\x80\x93 in order to better support IoT adoption and implementation. Together, let\xe2\x80\x99s explore how we can overcome these barriers so that more organizations can unleash IoT\xe2\x80\x99s potential. In upcoming posts, I\xe2\x80\x99ll examine ways to better apply Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT framework in water, manufacturing and other industries. Until then, take a closer look at where this all starts \xe2\x80\x93 at the edge \xe2\x80\x93 and why bringing intelligence to the edge is worth the effort.\nShare'",Tags: edge computing Internet of Things (IoT) IT Manufacturing OT security Utilities,"March 31, 2020",https://alln-extcloud-storage.cisco.com/Cisco_Blogs:blogs/1/2020/02/IL20200203213922-Vernon-Turner-scaled-150x150.jpg
145,How to secure the modern utility grid,Sean Song Jiang,"b'Utilities are embracing modernization efforts to increase efficiency and reliability and enable renewable energy. But there\xe2\x80\x99s another trend utilities must account for: cyberattacks. Attacks in July of 2019 against the US and in December of 2015 against the Ukraine power grid proved that a cyberattack can take utilities offline, endangering lives and incurring significant financial costs. While various utilities are at different stages of grid modernization, they should always keep security as the top priority to reduce the risk of a cyberattack. Below, we overview both the challenges and a three-prong approach to ensuring the safety of today\xe2\x80\x99s utility grid.\nCybersecurity challenges for utilities\nUtilities face several challenges when it comes to detecting and responding to cybersecurity attacks. The first is a lack of visibility. Operators can only stop malicious activities they can see \xe2\x80\x93 they need to know and be aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the network. Currently, most control systems monitor the network, but they lack the visibility and insight that operators require to detect and stop a cyberattack.\nThe second cybersecurity challenge is a lack of mitigation. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do a whole lot of good to be able to see malicious activity if you can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything about it. Utilities need technologies that enable them to stop cyberattacks. This requires a variety of cybersecurity technologies working together seamlessly. And that brings us to a third challenge: the integration of these technologies to ensure effective and efficient incident response. If the various layers of security controls do not \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d to each other smoothly and share data, then utilities will struggle with operational overhead.\nA three-prong approach to securing utilities\nHere at Cisco we have a three-prong approach to securing utilities. It begins with Cisco Cyber Vision, which provides visibility of the network and edge intelligence. Cisco Cyber Vision allows operators to see East/West control system communications and device communications. It then performs deep packet inspection of control traffic to expose what devices are communicating with each other and why. It also conducts a baseline of the traffic and generates an alert if there\xe2\x80\x99s an anomaly in or between control systems.\nThe second prong in Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s approach to securing the utility grid is the implementation of defense in depth to mitigate attacks. Cisco has all of the network security equipment that comprises a defense-in-depth strategy. We also have a proven, holistic security architecture that covers the edge of the grid to control center and provides separation and segmentation to prevent attacks from entering through IT. These pre-validated integrations \xe2\x80\x94 Cisco Validated Designs \xe2\x80\x94 simplify deployment and operations while greatly reducing your risks and security operations cost.\nFinally, a cybersecurity solution requires collaboration between both IT security and operations teams. Each team brings their own skills and experience to the table. The IT security team is typically savvy in cybersecurity and common defense and mitigation schemes. The OT team has the insight of protocols and processes of the operational network. A security program will be enormously successful if IT and OT work closely together, complementing each other\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, skills, and experience. Cisco has long been a leader in IT networking and security, and we can be your trusted adviser in grid cybersecurity.\nOrganizations simply cannot modernize the utility grid without incorporating cybersecurity \xe2\x80\x94 it is a requirement for operating in the 21st century. Cyberattacks are a proven threat. Therefore, cybersecurity must be a key component of a modernization effort. This requires visibility, controls to mitigate attacks, and the cooperation between IT and OT. Cisco has helped hundreds of utilities organizations around the world implementing this three-prong approach to cybersecurity and can help you, too.

146,"Testing Wi-Fi 6, private LTE, and soon, 5G — with the help of robots",Patrick Grossetete,"b'With so many wireless technologies available \xe2\x80\x94 including up-and-comers Wi-Fi 6, private LTE (CBRS band), and 5G \xe2\x80\x94 selecting the right one for your industrial IoT deployment can present quite a challenge. Over the past 30 years, many access technologies have come and gone, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that no single solution fits every scenario. To choose the best option for your business, we advise starting with these steps:\nDefine your use cases\nIdentify your application requirements\nDetermine the environment and deployment constraints\nI previously discussed each of these and more in greater detail in the blog post A Four-Step Guide to Selecting a Wireless Technology. Because wireless isn\xe2\x80\x99t a one size fits all, we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly testing and validating emerging technologies to ensure that we help customers select the best solution for their use case.\nThe internet of things (IoT) is really all about connectivity and using that connectivity to drive outcomes. In warehouses and distribution centers, the goal is to fill as many orders as possible on a given day or shift. Recently, manufacturing customers have asked us about using autonomous robots to address this \xe2\x80\x94 to that end, we decided to test Wi-Fi 6 and Private LTE for an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) in a warehouse setting to determine both feasibility as well as reliability of the wireless signal.\nTo conduct this test, we engaged the Cisco warehouse team in San Jose. This team was immediately able to brainstorm three potential use cases for an AMR: 1) moving goods, 2) conducting inventory, and 3) security monitoring. This goes to show the importance of working with your operations team when exploring industrial IoT use cases \xe2\x80\x94 they will be able to quickly and more easily identify the most practical use cases.\nEvery good test has a set of requirements, desired outcomes, constants and variables. Wireless technologies for industrial IoT must be easy to use, reliable and scalable. While testing Wi-Fi 6 and Private LTE, we specifically evaluated:\nHow to automate the deployment of the technology in the context of SD-WAN\nWhether AMRs would become stuck by radio interference\nHow many AMRs could be deployed in a single distribution center\nEach access technology was deployed while the IP network \xe2\x80\x94 SD-WAN-based \xe2\x80\x94 enabled local traffic and Internet cloud services access. After the initial prototype\xe2\x80\x99s development, deployment of the products, and configuration of the overall end-to-end data flow, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say that the testing was a success!\nInstead of giving away all the details, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to watch the video we recorded, so you can see for yourself how Wi-Fi 6 reliability can reach low latency numbers, while Mobile Packet Core may be set with User Plane Function locally switching the traffic over the CBRS p-LTE band. Each test was conducted with the results recorded for future validated design guide development \xe2\x80\x94 so, what\xe2\x80\x99s next? We\xe2\x80\x99re excited to be testing 5G, and more.

147,Modeling the 5G-powered smart city today that will protect us tomorrow,Ken Davidson,"b'As coronavirus spreads rapidly across the world, we feel the impact of global urbanization and population density. The UN projects that by 2050, 68 percent of the world population will live in urban areas. One of the new great human challenges before us is to figure out how to make our civilizations smarter, more proactive, and responsive to keep us safe. Smart cities offer a way to keep us thriving, both day to day, and in the face of crises like climate change, pandemics, and terrorism.\nThankfully, the technology to enable that is well on its way to roll out globally. 5G supports a wide range of use cases needed to make smart IoT-powered cities run \xe2\x80\x93 from the simple smart water meter all the way to the autonomous EMS vehicle. By 2023, we expect 5G will represent 10 percent of total global mobile connections with even higher concentrations in key markets, according to the Cisco Annual Internet Report, 2019.\nNaturally, service providers are rushing to prepare all the technical requirements to roll out 5G\xe2\x80\x99s potential. But the industry can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. Service providers must partner with technologists, enterprises, and governments to define how to use 5G effectively.\nCisco is committed to working with service provider partners and clients to harness 5G to create real value. Service providers can leverage Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s end-to-end portfolio of cloud-native core network functions and IoT portfolio that includes industrial networking, cybersecurity, management, data, and edge compute to provide complete solutions. 5G can also be used in tandem with other wireless and cellular access technologies depending on the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s business need and use cases.\nBy the end of 2020, Cisco IoT Control Center, our leading cellular connectivity management platform, will have 5G stand-alone (SA) readiness. It will also orchestrate connectivity across all 5G service layers \xe2\x80\x93 including NB-IoT, enhanced mobile broadband, and ultra-reliable low latency communications. Service provider offerings can be tailored to the unique needs of each 5G use case.\nAs part of our 5G incubation program, Cisco is codifying key use cases. We\xe2\x80\x99ve pinpointed hotbeds of 5G opportunity \xe2\x80\x93 verticals with strong IoT growth projections that are also inherently mobile. Our SVP of Incubation and Emerging Technologies, Liz Centoni, discussed 5G\xe2\x80\x99s potential across industrial IoT. We also expect 5G will make a difference in energy (24 percent IoT CAGR), connected city infrastructure (26 percent IoT CAGR), and connected cars (30 percent IoT CAGR). We think these possibilities come together in the smart city of the near future. In our model, a smart city includes three key areas: smart utilities and services, smart crowd management systems, and smart roads supporting autonomous vehicles. Let\xe2\x80\x99s explore the possibilities:\nSmart utilities and services\nSmart utilities harness sensors and connectivity to monitor and respond to water, trash, and energy usage in real time. Imagine:\nidentifying water main leaks and dispatching repair teams before an outage occurs\nmonitoring real-time energy consumption and pricing and redirecting locally stored renewable energy on demand to keep bills low\nabolishing \xe2\x80\x9ctrash days\xe2\x80\x9d and collecting trash only when smart waste bins are full\nSmart crowd management systems\nSmart crowd management systems with intelligent monitoring and facial recognition help manage crowds, traffic, and security issues. Imagine:\nreducing traffic by automatically directing circling cars to open parking spots\nusing crowd monitoring technology to predict wait times, redirect pedestrian traffic, and dispatch employee support based on crowd sizes\nidentifying lost children or suspicious persons in a dense crowd using facial recognition\ntracking public health outbreaks and pandemics like the coronavirus and automatically routing crowds away from impacted areas such as public transportation, in airports, and in common gathering spaces\nSmart roadways and autonomous vehicles \nSmart roadways connect traffic lights, roads, bridges, streetlights, and signage with the autonomous vehicles that drive on them. Imagine:\nsupporting a city of self-driving vehicles that communicate with the road and other vehicles to avoid collisions, automatically reroute around accidents, and offer a productive commute full of streaming services and entertainment\nminimizing traffic and road damage by synchronizing traffic lights to route heavy load-bearing vehicles through a city as quickly as possible\ncreating safer school zones and intersections with responsive signage and traffic lights that signal the presence of and protect pedestrians\nCisco is committed to working with service provider partners and clients to make the smart city a reality for us all. We will be especially focused on codifying 5G use cases to show you how to use this emerging technology to make your community safer and more sustainable.

148,Taking your industrial networking deep into the ground: Cisco IoT and Sandvik modernize mining operations in Sweden,Sarah Roper,"b'Tucked into the pastoral landscape of northern Sweden, Boliden, a mining and smelting company that concentrates on the production of copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver, quietly hums away at operations.\nMining for precious metals and other resources was once traditionally manual, grueling work. Miners would go underground for hours, often in unsafe working conditions.\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s mining processes couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more different. They have been transformed to be safer, more efficient, and cost effective thanks to the modernization of mining operations. With the help of Cisco IoT and our partner Sandvik Mining and Rock Technology, IoT solutions play an important role in improving those operations.\nMore than a kilometer underground at the Boliden mining site in Garpenberg, Cisco IoT and Sandvik technologies are at work. Although the mining industry has seen modernization by leaps and bounds, mines are still very wet, dangerous environments with toxic gases and are one of the most challenging environments in which to have an IT network.\nBut unlike mining of the past, Boliden operates large machinery, such as loaders like the LH517s with a 17.2 metric ton capacity. These operate remotely and autonomously in areas that could be unsafe to send people. With the support of Sandvik\xe2\x80\x99s AutoMine\xc2\xae for autonomous mining equipment and Sandvik\xe2\x80\x99s OptiMine\xc2\xae software to analyze and optimize production, Boliden mining engineers can remotely (and safely) operate the machinery from a control room. The Sandvik technology runs reliably on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s low latency IoT network made up of Cisco industrial switches and access points.\nThis also makes it possible for Boliden mining engineers to work in a cleaner, healthier environment.\nJacob Wallen, a mine automation engineer for Boliden said it best when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would trust Cisco with my life.\xe2\x80\x9d A network you can trust is a network that can save lives.\nTo learn more about how Cisco and Sandvik are modernizing mining operations, see the full Sandvik and Boliden case study here.

149,Cisco and Microsoft partner to enable seamless data orchestration from Cisco IoT Edge to Azure IoT Cloud,Vikas Butaney,"b'Does your business care about the number of connected IoT devices? Most of you would say no, not anymore. Rather, you have shifted the focus onto harnessing IoT data to run your business. Imagine if you had complete visibility to all aspects of your business: starting with an inventory of connected devices to access relevant information to make the best business decisions. Access to that relevant data will reduce risk, grow revenues, enhance customer experiences, and control costs. However, you have to tackle the variety of IoT devices and their different connectivity protocols which could stop you from creating a common data model today. Your industry peers continue to identify complexity of the current multi-vendor technology stacks as a key inhibitor to successfully deploy IoT projects.\nThe Cisco and Microsoft Azure IoT partnership\nWhen IoT solutions are deployed in remote industrial environments such as service fleets, oil pipelines, and mines to name a few, it brings a new understanding of what the IoT edge is. It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that a Gartner prediction shows that by 2025 more than 75 percent of data extracted will need edge computing. To address the seamless movement of data from the IoT edge and give customers the opportunities to unlock business value from their data, I am happy to announce that Cisco and Microsoft Azure are extending our edge-to-cloud partnership. Cisco Edge Intelligence eliminates the complexity of managing data extraction from devices at the IoT edge with an out-of-the-box integration into Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Azure IoT Hub, providing customers a simplified end-to-end capability.\nOne of the outcomes of this partnership will be to offer customers a pre-integrated IoT edge-to-cloud application solution. Customers will be able to integrate their IoT devices through Cisco Edge Intelligence to Azure IoT Hub with a click of a button. Both Cisco and Microsoft have made it simpler, faster and more secure to send intelligent IoT edge data to enterprise-class applications. Customers will be able to drive their artificial intelligence, analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence applications to support a better digital transformation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe seamless and simple integration of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT gateway with the new Edge Intelligence and Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Azure IoT Hub speeds the evolution to edge-to-cloud computing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tony Shakib, Head of Business Development, IoT at Microsoft. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite the complexity of data types and connectivity protocols, Cisco and Microsoft have removed these deployment challenges thus making the integration happen with just a few clicks. Cisco customers can stand up their deployments and get their business insights faster than ever \xe2\x80\x93 whether that data is from edge or cloud-based applications.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlready, customers in a variety of industry verticals are taking advantage of this partnership as they deploy more IoT solutions at the edge of the network. For example, voestalpine, a leader and manufacturer of high-quality steel, is benefiting from this integration in several ways. Cisco Edge Intelligence is being used to extract and transform typical factory floor data into valuable plant management information with seamless integration with Azure IoT service. To improve operations, voestalpine is using Cisco Edge Intelligence to ensure that IoT data is segmented and accessed by the right plant vendors while at the same time feeding its corporate systems on the centralized Azure cloud.\n \xe2\x80\x9cAt voestalpine, we are going through a digital journey to rethink and innovate manufacturing processes to bring increased operational efficiency. We face challenges to consistently and securely extract data from these machines and deliver the right data to our analytics applications,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stefan P\xc3\xb6chtrager, Enterprise Architect, voestalpine AG. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are validating Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s next-generation edge data software, Cisco Edge Intelligence, along with Azure IoT services for our cloud software development. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-the box edge solution with Azure IoT services helps us accelerate our digital journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCisco and Microsoft have plans to expand this integration to other areas where we can further simplify the IoT solution for our common customers. We invite our customers and partners who use Azure today to leverage this tight integration to build IoT solutions easily and quickly, helping achieve business goals faster and more efficiently.\nFor more information, check out the Cisco Edge Intelligence home page.

150,The road to industrial IoT security,Fabien Maisl,"b'One of the main topics of this year\xe2\x80\x99s RSA Conference is IT-OT cybersecurity convergence. But what are we talking about? Industrial IoT (IIoT) is all around us: in water, in gas, and electricity distribution networks, running power plants and critical infrastructure, in production lines and transportation networks, and more.\nIn the traditional IT world, security risks involve threats that would undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. Given that in 2019, $3.5 billion was lost to known cyber-scams and ransomware according to the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s Internet Crime Report, the impact is largely financial.\nIIoT drives the physical world where operational technologies (OT) are used. The risk in IIoT environments involves threats that would undermine the operational safety (physical security of goods and people, environmental impact) and the availability or even the physical integrity of the production process. Theft of intellectual property and trade secrets is a major concern, and the impact is not just financial, but also social, human, and ecological.\nWith 150 million IIoT devices coming online by 2021, industrial networks have become a target for hackers. Cyber attacks on IoT devices surged 300 percent in 2019, and 41.2 percent of ICS computers were attacked at least once in H1 2019.\nWhat can be done? Cisco has put together this infographic that provides you with a roadmap to ensuring the continuity, resilience, and safety of operations as you secure OT environments. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how:\nStep 1: Identify your industrial assets\nThe old adage \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t protect what you can\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x9d remains the primary challenge in securing OT environments. To build and enforce your security policies, you need to know all of your industrial assets, understand who and what they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating with, and identify high risk vulnerabilities to patch.\nStep 2: Segment your control networks\nIndustrial security best practices suggest migrating networks toward architectures compliant with ISA99/IEC-62443, which calls for the creation of zones and conduits. This is about placing assets that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to each other into isolated network segments to reduce the risk of an attack propagating across your entire industrial infrastructure.\nStep 3: Enforce security policies\nAs the industrial domain is exposed to both traditional IT threats and targeted attacks aimed at modifying the industrial process, automatically enforcing policies specific to your OT environment becomes critical. Additionally, you need to be able to identify intrusions from the IT domain, attempts to modify industrial assets and processes, and control communications on your industrial network.\nStep 4: Monitor industrial processes\nLeverage the time and money you\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in your IT cybersecurity environment to block attacks on your industrial network before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.  Detect anomalies in your industrial processes to identify unexpected changes to machine configurations and early signs of an attack.

151,For your industrial IoT deployment: A four-step guide to selecting a wireless technology,Patrick Grossetete,"b'Most everyone agrees that wireless technology is a key pillar of the Internet of Things. Exactly which wireless technology is a different story. Opinions may vary from enterprises, to service providers or vendors, but one size does not fit all. The best wireless technology is the one that addresses the requirements for your industrial IoT use case. How could an OT manager make sure he or she will select the most appropriate technology for his/her use case(s)? To help with the decision process, here\xe2\x80\x99s a step-by-step guide defining selection criteria for wireless technology.\nStep 1: Define your use case\nIt can be easy to get lost in the alphabet soup of wireless technologies: LPWAN (LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE CatM), Wi-SUN Mesh, Wi-Fi 5, Wi-Fi 6, 4G/LTE, and 5G to name a few. But as with any technology decision, organizations should start the selection process by considering the use case they want to apply it to. What industry do you operate in, and what exactly are you trying to achieve with your industrial IoT deployment? Are you a manufacturing company automating its industrial operations? Maybe a utility company connecting substations? Or an oil and gas company digitizing plant and field operations? Each of these use cases (and many more I haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned) have different requirements and therefore different wireless technology options.\nAs part of this step, determine and document whether your deployment will be:\nan indoor or outdoor deployment\nusing wireless technology as backhaul or for access\nleveraging public or private wireless services\nconnecting fixed or mobile devices\nattaching devices powered with electricity or with batteries\nStep 2: Identify your application requirements\nWith your use case well understood, you can focus on the application itself. What are the application\xe2\x80\x99s end-to-end requirements for throughput, resilience, latency and scale? How will you ensure that Key Performance Indicators (KPI) or Service Level Agreements (SLA) will get guaranteed and validated? Document each of these.\nStep 3a: Determine environment/deployment constraints\nThe next consideration is the site\xe2\x80\x99s location and numbers. Where will you deploy your industrial IoT solution, and how will the geographic location and environment impact your deployment? What are the spectrum regulations for those sites? You may also have environmental constraints to consider, such as temperature, humidity, vibration, and shock. Or you may have to plan for geographical spread. These factors should also be included in your wireless technology selection criteria.\nStep 3b: Identify data and security requirements\nThe geographic location of your deployment may also require you to comply with laws and regulations pertaining to data privacy and security. Leveraging public wireless or managed services call for security and management policies to be aligned between the enterprise and service provider. Note any data and security requirements for your deployment.\nStep 4: Technology options\nAt last, you have a list of selection criteria that you can use to identify the best wireless technology for your industrial IoT deployment. You may find that it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly easy to identify the one technology that fits your use case. However, if you find that there are a couple viable options for a single use case, then use the following criteria to further narrow down your choices:\nAvailability \xe2\x80\x93 Do you have access to the technology in your geographic area? Is there spectrum available? Are the products mature enough for production deployment?\nComplexity and supportability \xe2\x80\x93 Who will manage the network? Do you have the internal resources and automation tools to support it? How will you train the working force?\nExtensibility and repeatability \xe2\x80\x93 Will the technology scale to meet the needs of your current and (possibly) future use cases? Does it have the transmission power, signal penetration, and bandwidth capacity to cover additional use cases? How does it integrate in the existing production, avoiding disruption or additional operational end-to-end constraints? How does it play with cybersecurity and edge computing?\nCost \xe2\x80\x93 What is the total cost of ownership for the ecosystem? Be sure to take into account your devices and network infrastructure, subscription costs, operations costs, and backward compatibility. How does it align with your enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s strategy regarding CapEx and OpEx?\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified the wireless technology for your deployment, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to begin the vendor or service provider selection process that will support you through your deployment. A word of warning: avoid the temptation to look for a path that specifically supports one technology at the cost of all the others. Remember that Layer-1 and -2 technologies quickly evolve over time, which is why end-to-end communications are based on the Internet Protocol (IP). Being technology neutral will better position you through your current deployments as well as any future production deployments, which may or may not use the same wireless technology. No single wireless technology is a best fit for all use cases \xe2\x80\x93 even within the same industry or organization.\nStay tuned as we continue to discuss wireless technologies on this blog channel.

152,Cisco IoT Control Center: New innovations to help you manage IoT cellular at scale,Ken Davidson,"b'By 2023, 34 percent of all mobile connections will be IoT connections, up from 13 percent in 2018 (Cisco Annual Internet Report, 2019). As the leading cellular connectivity management platform, Control Center reflects this accelerating IoT trend day to day in our device counts. Since we acquired Jasper and its software platform Control Center in 2016, the platform has grown 800 percent. We have more than 160M cellular devices connected, including 60M connected cars. Our monthly growth is up to 4M new devices and accelerating. Our customers choose us over and over because we help them tackle one of their most pressing business problems \xe2\x80\x93 managing cellular IoT connectivity at scale. As we sit on the cusp of 5G\xe2\x80\x99s explosive growth, Cisco only sees this challenge becoming more urgent for service providers.\nToday Cisco is excited to announce the platform\xe2\x80\x99s next round of market-leading innovations and a new brand \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco Jasper Control Center is now Cisco IoT Control Center. Our enhanced platform integrates with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive IoT portfolio. This combination empowers service providers to build a robust IoT services business both today and as 5G evolves. We\xe2\x80\x99re proud that IoT analyst and tech evangelist James Brehm recently stated, \xe2\x80\x9cCisco IoT Control Center is the leading connectivity management platform, helping service providers on multiple fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take a sneak peek at the new innovations, starting with data.\nMachine learning automates IoT management\nIoT generates vast amounts of data per day \xe2\x80\x93 quantities that surpass any human\xe2\x80\x99s ability to process. IoT businesses are trying to become proactive \xe2\x80\x93 they need to know customer problems exist well before the customer calls with complaints. Cisco has observed that when devices proliferate, service provider support problems worsen exponentially.\nBut there is an antidote \xe2\x80\x93 by applying machine learning to connectivity data, you can find needles in the haystack and identify problems before they impact customers. Cisco IoT Control Center\xe2\x80\x99s new proactive IoT functionality helps in two ways. First it identifies abnormal behavior that often indicates security issues or malfunctioning equipment, and second it reduces connectivity costs by automatically adjusting rate plans. Through these capabilities, service providers can proactively alert customers to potential problems and empower users to address them right in Control Center before they have a negative impact.\nAstus, which specializes in adaptive telemetry and fleet management, was a beta customer of this innovation through one of our service provider partners. Alberto Mouron, Director of Information Technologies & Operations at Astus was delighted by the results. \xe2\x80\x9cCisco IoT Control Center\xe2\x80\x99s proactive IoT capabilities allow us, among other functionalities, to optimize our data plans and achieve significant cost savings of up to 20 percent!\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, service providers enjoy lowered support costs and avoid unpredictable customer credits, which are an industry-wide pain point when customers call with bill shock.\nSimplifying SIM portability between operators\nA second challenge to address is SIM portability. Today, when service providers transfer SIM management to other carriers, they must manage multiple costly integrations. The process is difficult and error prone and will only intensify as global supply chains become the norm. Cisco IoT Control Center now provides eSIM as a service, enabling a true, turnkey SIM portability solution that delivers on the original vision of eSIM: fast, reliable, cost-effective SIM handoffs between service providers.\nSmoothing the evolution to 5G\n5G is revolutionary because it can support a diverse range of use cases, from simple to complex, at very high device densities \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a clear choice for powering IoT. However, service providers need to focus on more than preparing networks upgrades to ensure 5G\xe2\x80\x99s success. The third challenge service providers must tackle is turning 5G possibilities into concrete examples and bringing high-value use cases to market at scale.\nCisco is partnering with both key service providers and their customers to incubate and codify common 5G use cases that will drive industry value. Our work with Dutch service provider KPN and machine builder ExRobotics, for example, explores using autonomously guided robots to perform jobs that are too dangerous for humans in fields like oil & gas. ExRobotics, is building robots that will be able to do much more sophisticated tasks when the ultra-low latency of 5G becomes widely available. KPN and Cisco are working to help translate this use case into clear protocol for implementing robot-aided safety checks in dangerous industries.\nMaurice Janssen Duijghuijsen, Vice President of Sales, IoT & Data Driven Solutions, pledges, \xe2\x80\x9cKPN and Cisco are committed to providing strategic thought leadership to help customers leverage cellular IoT and drive their digital transformation forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy 2023, 5G will make up more than 10 percent of global mobile connections, with even higher concentrations in key markets like North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific (Cisco Annual Internet Report, 2019). Control Center is committed to bringing the same scale to 5G and now supports 5G Non-standalone (NSA), with 5G Standalone (SA) readiness by the end of 2020. Service providers can trial 5G capabilities and tailor service offerings to meet specific performance needs today, such as private 5G. They can evolve to latency-sensitive use cases as slicing is rolled out.\nFor years, service providers have relied on Control Center to manage their cellular networks, and now thanks to Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s innovations, the future is even brighter. Service providers can continue to depend on Cisco IoT Control Center as their launchpad for achieving cellular IoT at scale today and as 5G evolves.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more, please visit our website on Control Center.\n  Share'",Tags: 5G cellular cellular IoT Cisco Jasper connectivity Control Center eSIM ExRobotics innovation Internet of Things (IoT) IoT management KPN machine learning SIM,"February 20, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1536255975-bpfull.jpg
153,Setting a simple standard: Using MQTT at the edge,Mirko Grabel,"b'In an earlier post, I shared examples of how organizations can benefit from edge computing \xe2\x80\x93 from enabling autonomous vehicles in transportation and preventive maintenance in manufacturing to streamlining compliance for utilities. I also recently shared examples on where the edge really is in edge computing. For operational leaders, edge compute use cases offer compelling business advantages. For IT leaders, such use cases require reliable protocols for enabling processing and transfer of data between applications and a host of IoT sensors and other devices. In this post, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to explore MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) and why it has emerged as the best protocol for IoT communications in edge computing.\nWhat is MQTT?\nMQTT is the dominant standard used in IoT communications. It allows assets/sensors to publish data, for example, a weather sensor can publish the current temperature, wind metrics, etc. MQTT also defines how consumers can receive that data. For example, an application can listen to the published weather information and take local actions, like starting a watering system.\nWhy is MQTT ideal for edge computing?\nThere are three primary reasons for using this lightweight, open-source protocol at the edge. Because of its simplicity, MQTT doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require much processing or battery power from devices. With the ability to use very small message headers, MQTT doesn\xe2\x80\x99t demand much bandwidth, either. MQTT also makes it possible to define different quality of service levels for messages \xe2\x80\x93 enabling control over how many times messages are sent and what kind of handshakes are required to complete them.\nHow does MQTT work?\nThe core of the MQTT protocol are clients and servers that send many-to-many communications between multiple clients using the following:\nTopics provide a way of categorizing the types of message that may be sent. As one example, if a sensor measures temperature, the topic might be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cTEMP\xe2\x80\x9d and the sensor sends messages labeled \xe2\x80\x9cTEMP.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPublishers include the sensors that are configured to send out messages containing data. In the \xe2\x80\x9cTEMP\xe2\x80\x9d example, the sensor would be considered the publisher.\nIn addition to transmitting data, IoT devices can be configured as subscribers that receive data related to pre-defined topics. Devices can subscribe to multiple topics.\nThe broker is the server at the center of it all, transmitting published messages to servers or clients that have subscribed to specific topics.\nWhy choose MQTT over other protocols?\nHTTP, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are other potential options at the edge. Although I could write extensively on each, for the purposes of this blog, I would like to share some comparative highlights.\nA decade ago, HTTP would have seemed the obvious choice. However, it is not well suited to IoT use cases, which are driven by trigger events or statuses. HTTP would need to poll a device continuously to check for those triggers \xe2\x80\x93 an approach that is inefficient and requires extra processing and battery power. With MQTT, the subscribed device merely \xe2\x80\x9clistens\xe2\x80\x9d for the message without the need for continuous polling.\nThe choice between AMQP and MQTT boils down to the requirements in a specific environment or implementation. AMQP offers greater scalability and flexibility but is more verbose; while MQTT provides simplicity, AMQP requires multiple steps to publish a message to a node. There are some cases where it will make sense to use AMQP at the edge. Even then, however, MQTT will likely be needed for areas demanding a lightweight, low-footprint option.\nFinally, like MQTT, CoAP offers a low footprint. But unlike the many-to-many communication of MQTT, CoAP is a one-to-one protocol. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, it\xe2\x80\x99s best suited to a state transfer model \xe2\x80\x93 not the event-based model commonly required for IoT edge compute.\nThese are among the reasons Cisco has adopted MQTT as the standard protocol for one of our imminent product launches. Stay tuned for more information about the product \xe2\x80\x93 and the ways it enables effective computing at the IoT edge.\nIf you want to learn more about it, I recommend taking a look at our DevNet IoT Sandboxes and Learning Labs. We cover, for example, MQTT in a learning lab here as well.\nI also want to thank Naveen Manicka for providing some of the details described above!\nAnd in case you missed it, check out my piece on where the edge is in edge computing.\n        Share'",Tags: amqp Cisco DevNet CoAP Computing edge edge computing HTTP Internet of Things (IoT) MQTT protocol,"February 18, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1572904361-bpfull.jpg
154,Where is the edge in edge computing?,Mirko Grabel,"b'Edge computing has become the IT industry\xe2\x80\x99s hot \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d term. Media outlets, vendors (including Cisco!), and analysts alike are all touting the value of edge computing, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) implementations. While most agree that there are benefits to processing compute functions \xe2\x80\x9cat the edge,\xe2\x80\x9d coming to an agreement on what exactly constitutes the edge is another thing altogether.\nSince publishing my introduction to edge computing blog post and giving a presentation on the topic at Cisco Live Barcelona, I\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered various viewpoints. So, I thought it would be helpful to establish where exactly is the edge \xe2\x80\x94 at least from Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.\nIn 2015, Dr. Karim Arabi, vice president, engineering at Qualcomm Inc., defined edge computing as, \xe2\x80\x9cAll computing outside cloud happening at the edge of the network.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDr. Arabi\xe2\x80\x99s definition is commonly agreed upon. However, at Cisco \xe2\x80\x94 the leader in networking \xe2\x80\x94 we see the edge a little differently. Our viewpoint is that the edge is anywhere that data is processed before it crosses the Wide Area Network (WAN). Before you start shaking your head in protest, hear me out.\nThe benefits of edge computing\nThe argument for edge computing goes something like this: By handling the heavy compute processes at the edge rather than the cloud, you reduce latency and can analyze and act on time-sensitive data in real-time \xe2\x80\x94 or very close to it. This one benefit \xe2\x80\x94 reduced latency \xe2\x80\x94 is huge.\nReducing latency opens up a host of new IoT use cases, most notably autonomous vehicles. If an autonomous vehicle needs to break to avoid hitting a pedestrian, the data must be processed at the edge. By the time the data gets to the cloud and instructions are sent back to the car, the pedestrian could be dead.\nThe other often cited benefit of edge computing is the bandwidth or cost required to send data to the cloud. To be clear, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of bandwidth available to send data to the cloud. Bandwidth is not the issue. The issue is the cost of that bandwidth. Those costs are accrued when you hit the WAN \xe2\x80\x94 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter where the data is going. In a typical network the LAN is a very cheap and reliable link, whereas the WAN is significantly more expensive. Once it hits the WAN, you\xe2\x80\x99re accruing higher costs and latency.\nDefining WHERE edge computing is\nIf we can agree that reduced latency and reduced cost are key characteristics of edge computing, then sending data over the WAN \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s to a private data center in your headquarters \xe2\x80\x94 is NOT edge computing. To put it another way, edge computing means that data is processed before it crosses any WAN, and therefore is NOT processed in a traditional data center, whether it be a private or public cloud data center.\nThe following picture illustrates the typical devices in an Industrial IoT solution and who claims to have \xe2\x80\x9cEdge Compute\xe2\x80\x9d in this topology:\nAs you can see, the edge is relative. The service provider\xe2\x80\x99s edge is not the customer\xe2\x80\x99s edge. But the most important difference between the edge compute locations depicted is the network connectivity. End devices, IoT appliances, and routers are connected via the LAN \xe2\x80\x94 maybe Wi-Fi or Gigabit Ethernet cable. That is usually a very reliable and cheap link. The link between the routers/gateways and cell tower, is the most critical. That\xe2\x80\x99s the last mile from the service provider. It introduces the most latency and is the most expensive for the end customer. It is the 5G or 4G uplink. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re on the cell tower, the provider has fiber and you\xe2\x80\x99re safe from a throughput perspective, but then you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at increasing costs.\nAs you can also infer from the graphic, end devices should be excluded from edge compute because it can be near impossible to draw the line between things, smart things and edge compute things.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s old is new\nWe can take the concept of edge computing a step further and assert that it\xe2\x80\x99s not new at all. In fact, we as an IT industry have been doing edge computing for quite some time. Remember how we learned about the cyclic behavior of compute centralization and compute decentralization? Edge compute is basically the latest term for decentralized compute.\nThe edge can mean very different things to different organizations, depending on the network infrastructure and use case. However, if you think about the edge in terms of the benefits you want to achieve, then it becomes clear very quickly where the edge of your IT environment begins and ends.\nIn the future, I\xe2\x80\x99ll explore some use cases to illustrate how the Cisco definition of edge computing applies in the real world. For now, I encourage you to read An Introduction to edge computing and use case examples. You can also watch the presentation on which this blog is based.\nResource\nWhat is Edge Computing?\nShare'",Tags: Computing data edge edge computing IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) LAN latency WAN,"February 11, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1572904361-bpfull.jpg
155,Cisco Cyber Vision: Under the hood,Fabien Maisl,"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting time for organizations that are migrating to Industry 4.0. Over the last few decades, industrial control systems (ICS) have enabled modern industrial automation. Today, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies present new opportunities to increase operational efficiency and launch a new generation of industrial products and services.  \nBut first, organizations must address security. Last week at Cisco Live in Barcelona we announced the first release of Cisco Cyber Vision, a solution designed to address these security challenges so that organizations can control cybersecurity risks and capture the benefits of Industry 4.0. \nProtecting industrial operations is a very specific challenge that can\xe2\x80\x99t be addressed with traditional IT security tools. Industrial processes can\xe2\x80\x99t come to a halt to install a patch. Disruption can have a devastating impact on human lives and/or the environment. To further complicate matters, attacks can be difficult to detect because they are often custom made and look like legitimate process instructions. \nCisco Cyber Vision is specifically designed for industrial organizations to ensure continuity, resilience, and safety of their operations. It provides full visibility into the ICS infrastructure, including dynamic asset inventory, real-time monitoring of process data, and threat intelligence, enabling operators to build secure infrastructures and enforce security policies to control risk. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look under the hood at these features and capabilities.  \nSecurity built into your industrial network \nComplexity is the enemy of security. Unfortunately OT cybersecurity can quickly become very complex, especially if the industrial network is dispersed across an entire country or many remote industrial sites. For an OT cybersecurity project to be successful, you must be able to scale it easily and at a reasonable cost across your entire organization.  \nCisco Cyber Vision leverages a unique edge computing architecture that enables security monitoring components to run within Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s industrial network equipment (IoT switches, routers, access points, industrial compute, etc.). That means there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to install and manage dedicated appliances. Nor do you need to configure SPAN ports and build an out-of-band network to send industrial network flows to a central security platform. Cyber Vision enables the industrial network to collect the information required to provide comprehensive visibility, analytics, and threat detection.  \nVisibility\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t secure an asset if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s there. OT teams need a precise view of their asset inventory, communication patterns, and network topologies. Cisco Cyber Vision brings visibility to the OT environment by building a list of all industrial assets down to the component level. Cyber Vision automatically uncovers the smallest details of the production infrastructure: Vendor references, firmware and hardware versions, serial numbers, PLC rack slot configuration, etc.  \nCisco Cyber Vision identifies asset relationships, communication patterns, changes to variables, and more. This wealth of information is shown in various types of maps, tables, and reports that maintain a complete inventory of industrial assets, their relationships, their vulnerabilities, and the programs they run. Cyber Vision makes it easy to group assets and define their \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial impact\xe2\x80\x9d so you can prioritize events according to your own safety targets. It summarizes all flows between zones, enabling you to monitor relevant traffic. \nGaining this level of visibility is key to drive network segmentation. This is about placing assets that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to each other into isolated network segments. Segmentation is one of the key recommendations of the ISA/IEC\xe2\x80\x9362443 OT security standards as it can help limit the spread of an attack. Cyber Vision shares asset profiles with Cisco ISE so you can create security groups based on asset characteristics. Cisco ISE will then dynamically enforce segmentation policies using TrustSec to configure network equipment. How much easier could it be?  \nOperational Insights \nCisco Cyber Vision gives OT engineers real-time insight on the industrial processes they manage. Cyber Vision \xe2\x80\x9cunderstands\xe2\x80\x9d the proprietary OT protocols used by automation equipment, so it can track process anomalies, errors, misconfigurations, and unauthorized industrial events such as unexpected variable changes or controller modifications. Control engineers can take action to maintain system integrity and production continuity. \nCisco Cyber Vision also records all these events. It becomes the \xe2\x80\x9cflight recorder\xe2\x80\x9d of the industrial infrastructure so cyber experts can easily dive into this data to analyze attacks and find the source. Security officers also have the information they need to document their incident reports and comply with new regulatory requirements such as NERC CIP or EU NIS. \nThreat detection and remediation \nThe industrial control network is exposed to both traditional IT threats and custom OT attacks designed to alter industrial processes. Organizations need holistic threat detection techniques to protect their industrial network and ensure production integrity, continuity, and safety.  \nCisco Cyber Vision combines protocol analysis, threat intelligence from Cisco research teams, intrusion detection, and behavioral analysis to detect any attack tactic. This holistic approach ensures Cyber Vision can detect both known and emerging threats as well as malicious behaviors that could be warning signs of an unknown attack. \nCisco Cyber Vision is fully integrated with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s leading security portfolio, providing your security operations centers with detailed information on OT assets and industrial threats. Security groups can be easily defined based on asset profiles. New filtering rules can be automatically triggered in the event of an attack. Security analysts can trace industrial events in their SIEM. Cyber Vision enables your existing cybersecurity environment to easily cope with the specificities of your industrial control network so you can build a unified IT/OT threat management strategy. \nCisco Cyber Vision enables organizations to ensure continuity, resilience, and safety of their industrial operations by providing continuous visibility over their ICS infrastructures and controlling the risks of cyber attacks.

156,A refreshing IoT solution for remote water monitoring,Sarah Roper,"b'Water authorities around the world work to ensure that clean, safe water flows from the sources to customers\xe2\x80\x99 homes. Just as flowing water is key to that mission, so, too, is flowing data. And for a growing number of water authorities \xe2\x80\x93 including the Ontario Clean Water Agency in Canada \xe2\x80\x93 IoT solutions are providing an innovative way to capture valuable real-time insights into water safety, system efficiency and more.\nThe Ontario Clean Water Agency delivers operations, maintenance and management services for more than 800 water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout the Province of Ontario. In serving as a \xe2\x80\x9cTotal Water Solutions Provider,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency helps customers meet Canada\xe2\x80\x99s stringent requirements related to monitoring of residual chlorine, floridity and other measures of water quality. Using Cisco IoT solutions, the agency is transforming how it gathers, stores and shares critical compliance data.\nConducting monitoring \xe2\x80\x93 and delivering complete, validated data in mandated timeframes \xe2\x80\x93 represents a significant challenge. It\xe2\x80\x99s an even bigger challenge given Ontario\xe2\x80\x99s size and the number of water and wastewater facilities that operate at the far corners of the province. With some local operators having to travel three or four hours to reach a facility, the ability to perform remote monitoring has become essential.\nWhen a First Nations community asked for remote monitoring from a central location, the Ontario Clean Water Agency initially proposed using its own proprietary solution. However, this customer was intent on using an independent, standards-based approach. That, in turn, presented a critical challenge: supporting areas with no Internet and spotty cellular service.\nFor help, the Ontario Clean Water Agency collaborated with Cisco and identified Cisco IoT routing technology with the help of antennas to provide strong cellular connectivity. The agency implemented Cisco 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (IR829) in six locations to meet the needs of the First Nations client. These routers, which have become the agency\xe2\x80\x99s new standard, provide highly secure, reliable and easy-to-manage 3G/4G LTE WAN cellular and Wireless LAN connectivity for mobile environments. And because they\xe2\x80\x99re both compact and designed to withstand harsh environments, they\xe2\x80\x99re ideal for connecting IoT devices and applications in virtually any location covered by the agency and its customers.\nThe solution for the First Nations client uses the Cisco IOx application environment, which combines Cisco IOs and Linux, to support two forms of data collection: local collection inside stainless steel control panels that house the Cisco routers plus integration with the cloud. In fact, the agency can store up to 100 Gigabits of data locally using the Cisco routers inside the steel panels.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may seem like overkill to store the data both locally and in the cloud. However, that approach reflects how valuable the data is to our clients. The IR829 routers make it easy for us to have the local backup in the panels,\xe2\x80\x9d says the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Director of Operational Systems Ciprian Panfilie. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one failure, and data quality is fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d\nData collection from inside the panels has another important advantage: the ability for local operators to view and analyze their own data, independent of any IT system or cloud provider. And the panels are proving to be fertile ground for other IoT apps that Panfilie and his team are actively investigating.\nThe successes of Panfilie and his team in Ontario show how flowing information can lead to waves of innovation for water authorities everywhere.\nClick here to learn more about the Ontario Clean Water Agency use case.\nShare'",Tags: compliance Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring network routing Utilities Water,"February 5, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1551977104-bpfull.jpg
157,Cisco Edge Intelligence: IoT data orchestration from edge to multi cloud,Anoop Mohan,"b'The next frontier of Internet of Things (IoT) is going to be won with the right applications. Applications deliver business outcomes that drive metrics for growth and profitability. However, the most common problem witnessed with these applications is getting clean and well-groomed data securely, reliably and consistently. Here enters IoT Edge Computing. It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that a Gartner survey shows that more than 75 percent of data extracted will need edge computing.  \nHowever, various challenges stand in the way of enabling this today: \nGeographically remote and distributed assets \xe2\x80\x93 The location of IoT assets vary from a dense urban area like traffic intersections to remote area like gas and water distribution where cellular connectivity is scarce \nHeterogeneous environments \xe2\x80\x93 IoT assets come from various manufacturers and no two manufacturers speak the same protocol or handle the same data model \nMultiple consumers of data \xe2\x80\x93 As the need for IoT data grows and the number of applications that can leverage data increases, making sure there are proper control and governance policies before the data leaves the network is an ever-growing challenge \nComplexity \xe2\x80\x93 Current approaches are often sub-scale and require custom software and integration of multi-vendor technologies that are overwhelmingly complex to deploy and manage \nCisco recently announced a new offering for IoT edge called Cisco Edge Intelligence. Cisco Edge Intelligence is a new IoT data orchestration software that extracts, transforms and delivers data of connected assets from edge to multi-cloud destinations with granular data control. It is a software service deployed on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT Gateway (GW)/ Networking portfolio for easy, out-of-the\xe2\x80\x93box deployments. \nCisco recently requested 451 research to conduct an analysis on the top issues with IoT deployment and the role of IoT edge. The research report helped validate the hypothesis of the problem and the solution that Cisco Edge Intelligence is addressing.   \nCisco is currently conducting early field trials/pilot projects with select customers such as voestalpine, Port of Rotterdam, AHT Cooling (Daikin), National Informatics Center \xe2\x80\x93 India and many more across roadways, water quality/distribution and remote industrial asset monitoring. Cisco Edge Intelligence will be available for public in 2Q CY 2020. Primary value proposition of Cisco Edge Intelligence is as follows: \nOut-of-the-box solution  \nCisco Edge Intelligence comes out of the box working on most of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT GW portfolio for plug\xe2\x80\x93and\xe2\x80\x93play operations, which is configured and managed using a SaaS or on-prem solutions. User experience is built grounds up after studying various industry user personas. Cisco Edge Intelligence has simplicity built into its core and makes data extraction, transformation, governance and delivery to its applications as easy as a click of a button. It can be deployed across thousands of gateways from a centralized location without having to worry about the underlying network configurations.  \nPre-integrated data extraction for specific industries \nCisco has learnt that the hardest and challenging aspect of IoT deployments is consistently extracting data from various greenfield and brownfield assets. Cisco Edge Intelligence comes pre-integrated with a curated set of asset/device connectors based on specific industries that allow customers to onboard IoT assets seamlessly. Further, it provides an ability for customers to add meta data that helps normalize data across vendors. \nConvert raw data to intelligent data  \nBased on feedback received, Cisco has embraced tools for development and debugging which are widely accepted by the community. Cisco Edge Intelligence provides scripting engines that allow customers\xe2\x80\x99 and partners\xe2\x80\x99 developers to develop scripts that can convert raw data to intelligent data. The scripts could be simple filtering, averaging, thresholding of data or complex analytical data processing for cleaning and grooming of data. These tools enable developers to remotely debug on a physical IoT GW and deploy with a click of a button from the same development interface.  \nGranular data governance  \nAs the promise of IoT is delivered with every small thing being connected, and as the number of applications that can make sense of the IoT data increase, the problem of N*M arises. \xe2\x80\x98N\xe2\x80\x99 things being source of data from multiple things from different manufacturers and \xe2\x80\x98M\xe2\x80\x99 applications being destination of data from multiple applications from different vendors. The goodness IoT brings, could become a chaos to deal with, if not addressed ahead of time.  \nAs this data deluge erupts, Cisco Edge Intelligence provides a fundamentally strong and holistic data control from the point of ingestion to consumption in a non-overwhelming way. \nPre-integrated with growing eco-system \nThe last and a key step necessary to deliver data to applications requires Cisco Edge Intelligence to be integrated with a growing set of platforms and applications. It is currently pre-integrated with one of the leading cloud providers and other platform/on-prem providers such as Software AG and Quantela. Cisco Edge Intelligence also supports standards based MQTT and encourages partners who are interested in working with Cisco to leverage the same. Cisco will continue to grow this ecosystem of IoT platform/application partners. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen customers take advantage of both Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s new Edge Intelligence running on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s GW and Software AG\xe2\x80\x99s Cumulocity IoT running in data center or cloud, they will be able to bring IoT asset data from edge to cloud quickly and seamlessly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yasir Qureshi, VP, IoT and Analytics at Software AG. \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping IoT simple with little or no coding has been a key to successfully unlocking the business value of the IoT on either edge or cloud-based applications.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCisco Edge Intelligence is a big step for Cisco IoT towards bridging the gap from where data is generated to where it is consumed. It offers an out\xe2\x80\x93of\xe2\x80\x93the\xe2\x80\x93box, plug\xe2\x80\x93and\xe2\x80\x93play solution for everything in between.

158,New Cisco Validated Designs offer customers more recipes for IoT success,Bryan Tantzen,"b'In the kitchen, you strive to use the highest-quality ingredients possible. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t typically serve one or two ingredients on a plate. Instead, you build a plan for what to serve and how to combine the ingredients to achieve the desired results. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a culinary whiz, you probably want that information from someone who has experience preparing that meal \xe2\x80\x93 and a track record of creating a great-tasting result.\nIn other words, you want a recipe from a proven expert for a proven result. Anything else is just a science experiment.\nThe same holds true in the IoT realm \xe2\x80\x93 where the stakes, are considerably higher than the quality of a dinner. That\xe2\x80\x99s the driving principle behind Cisco Validated Designs (CVDs). We know our products have proven to be the industry\xe2\x80\x99s best \xe2\x80\x9cingredients\xe2\x80\x9d for IoT networks.

We then engineer, test and validate each design for our customers\xe2\x80\x99 industry specific requirements, to guide their own deployments.\nAt Cisco Live Europe in Barcelona, we unveiled new and enhanced CVDs for oil and gas, manufacturing, power utilities and any organization seeking to extend its enterprise network beyond traditional carpeted spaces:\nNEW CVD for Oil & Gas Process Industries: From delivering greater visibility and efficiency to enhancing worker safety, wireless connectivity has become a critical enabler for every oil and gas business. This CVD provides a roadmap for implementing Cisco Intrinsically Safe Wi-Fi to realize those benefits more quickly and reliably.\nUPDATED CVD for Industrial Automation: Yes, you want to feel secure that you can implement a business changing solution. But you also want to know that the solution will reliably secure your manufacturing environment. This CVD incorporates the capabilities of Cisco Cyber Vision to address and mitigate the growing risk of cyberattacks from within your automation control systems.\nUPDATED CVDs for Utilities: We\xe2\x80\x99re announcing a holistic Grid Security CVD for protecting power substations from cyber threats. This CVD includes operations asset and traffic visibility, network segmentation, authentication and access, threat detection and protection, as well as data encryption, enabled by Cisco Cyber Vision, ISA 3000, IE switches, ISE and Stealthwatch. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also enhanced our Secondary Substation CVD with the next level of easy deployment, resiliency and edge applications.\nUPDATED CVD for Extended Enterprise: When asked to add connectivity to kiosks, remote payment sites, warehouses or distribution centers, IT managers can\xe2\x80\x99t simply deploy the same gear they use in a data center or traditional carpeted space. But with this updated CVD, they can still enjoy same centralized, automated management through Cisco DNA Center.

159,Brought to you by Cisco: One secure network built for the modern utility grid,Sean Song Jiang,"b'The utilities industry is under tremendous pressure to integrate new energy sources and consumption models, improve service reliability, optimize operations, and lower costs \xe2\x80\x94 all while reducing cybersecurity risk. That\xe2\x80\x99s nearly impossible to achieve with the status quo. But with a comprehensive architecture from Cisco, utilities can have one secure network built for the modern utility grid. At DistribuTECH 2020 we\xe2\x80\x99ll show you how.\nUtilities face a number of business imperatives that can only be achieved by modernizing their aging infrastructure. However, the common approach of deploying multiple siloed networks increases complexity, which in turn increases headcount, operating costs, and cybersecurity risk.\nCisco offers a different approach to utility grid modernization. Our converged IP network supports both cellular and mesh, for flexibility and reduced complexity. We address distribution automation, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), and demand response (DR) all under one FAN \xe2\x80\x94 and enable its secure and scalable management under one pane of glass.\nOur security solution, Cisco Cyber Vision, provides owners and operators full visibility into their ICS infrastructures, so they can build secure infrastructures and enforce security policies to control risk. Cisco Cyber Vision leverages a two-tier architecture consisting of edge sensors and a central platform. The sensor software is embedded into Cisco network equipment and gives you visibility to devices that connects to it as well as their communication flows. This unique architecture enables utilities to deploy OT security at scale, quickly and at a reasonable cost. Cyber Vision fully integrates with existing IT security platforms so that security teams have all the details on your industrial assets and their behaviors.\nWe are at DistribuTECH this week, the leading annual electric power transmission and distribution conference and exhibition event, where we will feature many of these solutions, including:\nNew cybersecurity capabilities that protect both the network and applications in your substation and distribution deployments\nNew additions and features to our industry-leading ruggedized routing, switching, and wireless portfolio for DA, AMI, DR, and substation solutions\nNew software solutions to process data at the edge of the utility network\nNew enhancements to our utility Cisco Validated Designs for Distribution Automation\nNew Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) partnerships\nUnified management platforms for cellular, mesh, and LoRaWAN\xc2\xae\nWi-SUN compliant and certified solutions\nFor the past 30 years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helped our utility customers modernize their networks and operations. More than 200 utilities like innogy and Duke Energy now use Cisco utility-specific solutions, with even more customers spanning the globe. There are Cisco communication devices in over 10,000 substations in the U.S. and almost 11 million smart meters under contract. Cisco is proud to continue to solve modern utility challenges and be a part of DistribuTECH, the leading annual electric power transmission and distribution conference and exhibition event.\nWe hope to see you this week in San Antonio, Texas. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be at booth #1537, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be listening to your challenges and sharing approaches that add value to your grid operations.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Energy GRID Internet of Things (IoT) Mining network routing security Utilities Wi-Sun,"January 28, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1545174473-bpfull.jpg
160,"Cisco announces comprehensive IIoT security architecture, Cyber Vision for visibility and Edge Intelligence",Vikas Butaney,"b'IoT discussions have moved from counting the number of connected devices to use cases and value creation for each industry. Organizations in transportation, public sector, energy and manufacturing industries are looking to translate IoT edge data into meaningful information and derive business value. Across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s 70,000 IoT enterprise end customers, we see an acceleration of digitization projects that are connecting operational assets to a converged Ethernet and IP network \xe2\x80\x93 and IT is playing a critical role. While estimates on the number of connected devices might vary, there is agreement that cybersecurity is the #1 customer concern to execute IoT projects.\nTo make the digital enterprise a reality, IIoT projects in operational settings need to overcome three key challenges:\nLack of an up-to-date asset inventory with baseline of normal communication patterns to detect security and configuration anomalies\nFlat, unmanaged plant networks allow unfettered propagation of cybersecurity threats, risking system downtime, increasing risks to people, and the industrial processes\nWhile data is king, it is trapped in heterogeneous environments with industry-specific protocols that are foreign to IT and security tool sets\nTo enable customer success, Cisco has developed the Multi-Domain architecture to link visibility, automation, and policy from branch, data center, campus, and operational environments. Cisco IoT is announcing two key innovations that empower both IT and OT teams, furthering the Multi-Domain architecture:\nComprehensive IIoT security architecture and the release of Cisco Cyber Vision\nCisco Edge Intelligence, radically simplifies IoT Edge to multi-cloud data delivery and control for connected assets\nComprehensive IIoT cybersecurity architecture and Cisco Cyber Vision for OT visibility\nCisco is announcing a comprehensive Industrial IoT cybersecurity architecture to enable IT and OT to protect their operational environments with four key capabilities \xe2\x80\x93 Identification, policy definition, enforcement of the policy, and monitor ongoing operation of the entire system. Cisco Cyber Vision is the first software-based IIoT security solution embedded in the Cisco industrial networking portfolio. All operational traffic flows through the network, and Cisco is uniquely positioned to provide visibility for security and context for operations.\nCyber Vision passively analyzes traffic with deep protocol knowledge for discrete, process, and utilities industries, allowing IT and OT to secure while maintaining production integrity for operational environments.\nCisco Cyber Vision starts by discovering assets and decoding industry specific process flows using passive Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology. Using a combination of OT-specific rules and threat intelligence from Cisco Talos, it provides real-time anomaly detection and monitoring. The information gathered by Cisco Cyber Vision is critical to segmentation policies in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and DNA Center and removing the potential for unfettered propagation of threats across operational environments \xe2\x80\x93 something that has been a highly manual effort and does not keep up with changing requirements.\nCisco Cyber Vision is integrated with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IT security portfolio, bringing detailed information on OT assets and industrial threat detection to Cisco NGFW firewalls, Identity Services Engine for access control and segmentation, and network traffic analysis using Stealthwatch to provide the necessary context to IT security teams. Cisco Cyber Vision also integrates with leading SIEM platforms, such as IBM QRadar and Splunk, so you can collect all OT events in your IT SOC and build a unified IT-OT security program.\nCisco Edge Intelligence delivers data where it can be actioned \nCisco Edge Intelligence is a new IoT software offering that extracts, transforms and delivers connected asset data from IoT edge to multi-cloud destinations with granular data control. Like Cisco Cyber Vision, it is a software service deployed on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IIoT networking portfolio for easy, out-of-the box deployments.\nCurrent approaches require custom software and integrations of multiple vendor technologies that are complex to deploy and manage. Current offerings are further challenged with no easy way to control what data is delivered to specific applications running in multi-cloud environments.\nCisco Edge Intelligence enables organizations to regain IoT edge data ownership and control by:\nOut-of-box service on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IIoT networking portfolio with simplified user experience and scaled centralized deployment\nDeveloper-friendly tools to create intelligent data logic for IoT edge execution, after seamless data extraction from varieties of data sources\nAbility to govern the flow of IoT data at granular levels before data leaves the operational environments\nWe offer pre-integration with leading IoT platforms and applications to easily share data from IoT edge to multi-cloud destinations with a click of a button.We are excited to demonstrate this ability with Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Azure IoT Service, to accelerate IoT projects for our customers.\nOne of our joint early field customers, voestalpine, is benefiting from this integration as they digitize their operations to improve production plan and operational efficiencies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt voestalpine, we face challenges to consistently and securely extract data from these machines and deliver the right data to our analytics applications in multi-cloud destinations. To address these challenges, we are validating Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s next generation edge data software, Cisco Edge Intelligence. It is tightly integrated with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s edge infrastructure. The unified management and security help our IT and OT teams to work seamlessly. The flexibility for data transformation using multiple options make our solution scalable and future proof,\xe2\x80\x9d Stefan P\xc3\xb6chtrager Strategic IT-Management, Ing. voestalpine\xe2\x80\xafAG.\nNew and enhanced Cisco Validated Designs\nCisco Validated Designs (CVDs) are just that \xe2\x80\x93 engineered, tested and proven designs that integrate Cisco and third-party products to deliver use cases for key industries.

161,Cisco wins “Industrial IoT Innovation of the Year” in 2020 IoT Breakthrough Awards,Samuel Pasquier,"b'The Cisco IoT portfolio is pushing industrial IoT connectivity to the edge, using intent-based networking that\xe2\x80\x99s flexible, secure, scalable, and award-winning.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re honored to be named \xe2\x80\x9cIndustrial IoT Innovation of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d in the 2020 IoT Breakthrough Awards for our Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points, which extend the IoT edge to new frontiers across manufacturing, oil and gas, mining, food processing, and other industries.\nCisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points are purpose-built wireless access points for hazardous locations. Traditional access points have numerous restrictions\xe2\x80\x94they rarely meet regulatory requirements since they aren\xe2\x80\x99t designed for heavy industrial environments, they necessitate multiple vendors and significant modifications, and their customization can be both time consuming and costly\xe2\x80\x94making it challenging for businesses to realize real value and significant benefits of IoT in locations like mines, refineries, factory floors, and chemical plants. The Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points overcome conventional limitations with their IP67 rated, Class I, Division 2 certified form-factor that can withstand dust and water to operate in even the toughest of settings.\nEvery hazardous environment is unique. Whether a remote mine or local refinery, each location provides a different set of constraints, but presents the same additional value made available by digitization and connectivity. Monitor leaks, track assets and personnel, and control remote enabled devices from a central, safe location.\nImagine this scenario: \nA warning notification appears on the tablet of an oil refinery manager. A pipe\xe2\x80\x99s pressure is at critical levels and if something isn\xe2\x80\x99t done quickly, there could be a massive leak or explosion.\nBut with a few taps, she turns the intake off, allowing the pressure to diffuse. Then, using location awareness technology, she sees three workers nearby the pipe and dispatches them to fix it.\nA few moments later, the workers realize this particular piping system is more complex than they expected. Every minute this pipe is down is lost revenue for the plant, so resolving the issue and getting the plant back online is crucial.\nThey place a video call to an offsite expert, who guides them through the replacement process. The plant goes back online in record time, and the plant manager breathes a sigh of relief.\nNone of this would be possible without the Cisco Catalyst\xc2\xae IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points. They are the cornerstone of digitization for hazardous environments by providing resilient Wi-Fi connectivity.\nCisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points are the only heavy-duty access points on the market developed in conjunction with operational technology partners, enabling them to easily attach expansion modules to address specific use cases such as improving plant efficiency and safety using WirelessHART and ISA.100 wireless protocols.\nThe new access points deliver pervasive wireless connectivity including wireless mesh backhaul, providing mobile workers with highly secure, real-time data access in plant. Organizations can get reliable data collection, improve worker safety, and increase plant productivity \xe2\x80\x93 even in unpredictable conditions.\nThese new heavy-duty access points can leverage Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Intent-Based Networking technology, which removes the manual, time-intensive methods by which networks are traditionally managed. Instead, they capture business intent and translate it into network policy to make it easier to scale deployments. For the past few years, customers have been embracing this new way of managing networks across the campus and branch. Now, IT can work with operations to manage these IoT environments as well.\nCisco is continuing our legacy of innovation at Cisco Live 2020 next week in Barcelona, Spain. Join us to hear how our IoT solutions are transforming industries and accelerating the digital world.

162,"From the enterprise to the IoT edge, we have you covered with SD-WAN",Sripriya Narayanan,"b'Deploying a security patch to address a new vulnerability. Performing critical software updates or conducting network performance tests. As enterprises try to expand the scope of deployment from carpeted areas to outdoor environments \xe2\x80\x93 for example, a financial or retail institution, operating in thousands of distributed locations with outdoor assets, such as ATMs or kiosks \xe2\x80\x93 they encounter many challenges, given IT manages corporate network and Operational Technology (OT) manages the outdoor network. When something goes wrong, it becomes challenging to identify and resolve network issues with speed and efficiency.\nGiven the scope and scale of operations, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that dispatching service technicians to physically provision new devices, implement security patches, or perform maintenance updates is laborious and inefficient. When there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to tackle these activities across many distributed locations, it becomes extremely time consuming and expensive.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also risky as enterprises experience an ever-growing number of physical and cyber attacks. How can they be more responsive and reliable in safeguarding their assets? And how can they view all network activity and draw insights through a single dashboard ensuring that they can resolve issues with speed, security and efficiency?\nCisco IoT is collaborating with enterprises as they address these and other critical business challenges. With the launch of the Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged, we provided an industrial-grade solution for connecting outdoor/industrial locations. And with the recent launch of Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) architecture on the IR1101 that complements the SD-WAN on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise routers (Integrated Services Routers and Aggregation Services Routers), we\xe2\x80\x99re flat-out changing the game for how enterprises can effectively manage hundreds or thousands of disparate locations.\nSave time and reduce workloads as you scale. Our SD-WAN architecture enables a common overlay fabric for distributed networks, from enterprise to IoT edge, along with intelligent WAN policy management \xe2\x80\x93 making it possible to achieve simplicity at scale. So rather than sending a technician to each site \xe2\x80\x93 or even logging into multiple dashboards remotely \xe2\x80\x93 enterprises can see, secure and manage sites from a single Cisco vManage control center. That translates into greater visibility, control, and ultimately, time and cost savings.\nAutomate complex security setup \xe2\x80\x93 from enterprise to IoT edge. Security risks and threats are real. With SD-WAN, you can segment your network and manage access policies for each segment from end to end, protecting your business against data exfiltration and insider threats.\nSD-WAN empowers you with intelligent monitoring of failover and automated policy management across your distributed locations, giving you more uptime and reliability for mission-critical deployments.\nEnsure mission-critical infrastructure is uninterrupted. An SD-WAN architecture, whether deployed on-premises, or in the cloud, makes it easy to prioritize data and control the traffic.\nSave money with intent-based management. SD-WAN makes it easy to tailor network management based on your service level agreements. Ensure that traffic is routed through the appropriate \xe2\x80\x93 and cost-efficient \xe2\x80\x93 path (MPLS, Ethernet or LTE). Spend more on the traffic that merits it; leave the rest to less expensive paths.\nThe Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged with SD-WAN architecture creates a common overlay fabric across your distributed network so you can rest easy knowing that when it comes to network management and security, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it covered.

163,S4x20: The future of IIoT cybersecurity is here,Marc Blackmer,"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s common knowledge that risks to the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and critical infrastructure are increasing. As a case in point, our Talos threat research team is now discovering more IoT-related vulnerabilities on a regular basis than traditional \xe2\x80\x9cIT\xe2\x80\x9d vulnerabilities. This week, while preparing to head out to Miami for S4x20, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about how the awareness of these risks has also been on the rise. The first S4 event took place in January 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 13 years ago! You could easily say the organizers and those first attendees were ahead of their time. Fast forward to 2020, and vendors like Cisco understand the need for new skills and tools to address IIoT cybersecurity, and we\xe2\x80\x99re excited to share how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing so.\nS4\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to: \xe2\x80\x9cNurture and grow a community of talent that is creating the future of OT and ICS security through bold and innovative thinking and action.\xe2\x80\x9d Having been involved with S4 since 2014, I can say that the organization delivers on its mission.

164,Three IoT trends to watch this month,Patty Medberry,"b'The world of IoT continues to grow as our more than 70,000 customers take their deployments to the next level. Whether or not you are attending Cisco Live in Barcelona on January 27th \xe2\x80\x93 30th, you will want to tune in. Cisco will be making a lot of announcements, and addressing these three IoT trends.\n1. The network is the foundation for both IT and OT environments, but a multi-domain architecture is key\nWhile the network has always been the backbone for IT, it has quickly become the foundation for operational technology (OT) environments as well. OT needs data to help them improve customer experiences, enhance safety, increase efficiencies, and reduce costs. There is no better way to achieve these results than by mining data from key assets such as a machine on a factory floor, a fleet of service vehicles, or a remote pipe line. And this is where the importance of the network expands from IT into OT environments. To get the data that OT needs, assets must securely connect to a reliable network.  And with the amount of devices being connected, not just any network will do. Only Cisco is providing a true multi-domain architecture bringing common visibility and management across all domains \xe2\x80\x93 including the OT domain \xe2\x80\x93 making IoT projects easier to scale.  Look for how we are bringing bigger value to this network in the upcoming weeks.\n2. Edge compute and getting the most value out of your data\nEdge compute is creating a new set of use cases and business models by allowing data to be accessed and processed at the edge \xe2\x80\x93 without ever traversing the WAN. It allows organizations to deploy real-time applications anywhere \xe2\x80\x93 even on the side of the road where every second counts to ensure pedestrian and driver safety. Edge is a critical part of our IoT strategy as we work to bring the power of the enterprise to edge environments. It is integrated with our network so applications are easier to manage and deploy. As 5G and other innovation accelerators enter the market, Cisco is ready with edge computing solutions wherever they are needed, even harsh and remote environments.\nAs part of this, we will talk about the challenges around harnessing the data that will bring your business to the next level.  Does your organization have data deluge? Or a data drought? Do you know who has access to your data and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? Getting the right data to the right person at the right time can be critical to saving lives, edging out the competition, or reducing downtime. The key to doing this is Cisco IoT solutions. We will discuss how Cisco can help organizations tackle the data challenge including its collection, transformation and delivery so that you can make sense of it all.\n3. Security at the edge is more critical than ever, and IT and OT need to work together for its success\nAs millions of devices come online in operational environments, the cyber security risks grow exponentially. So, as the network becomes more distributed to connect these industrial environments, the security must become distributed too. In factories, for example, machine controllers are now smarter. They have their own software and CPU helping create more agile manufacturing environments. But, the combination of their intelligence and their network connectivity, is also making them more vulnerable to attacks. We will address how organizations can more easily secure these OT environments at scale.\nAlso, we touch on the importance of IT and OT working together. In order to implement security properly, a very diverse skillset is required \xe2\x80\x93 a skillset that only IT and OT together, can provide. IT understands how to secure networks, while OT are experts at optimizing their processes. Bringing together the knowledge of the network and security with the knowledge of the business and its process is critical for success. In the upcoming weeks, stay tuned as to how organizations can do this all successfully with Cisco.\nSo stay tuned, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear how Cisco is bringing all this together in Barcelona at Cisco Live! Come visit Cisco IoT this year at the show, or if you can\xe2\x80\x99t attend, check out the live stream of sessions here.\n  Share'",Tags: 5G edge IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) IT OT security,"January 16, 2020",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg
165,Bridging the divide: Getting IT and OT to work together for industrial IoT,David O‘Hara,"b'Industrial IoT has the potential to transform business processes in manufacturing, oil and gas, utilities, and more. However, organizations must first overcome numerous challenges, one of which is bridging the divide between IT and operational technology (OT). Having the right people involved and working together toward an IoT initiative is critical for achieving a seamless, secure and successful end-to-end design.\nWe often hear customers describe what it is they want out of an IoT deployment: a dashboard with buttons that allows them to see data or analytics of that data to understand what is happening in the operating environment. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious they have a clear vision of the outcome they want, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to get there. And they can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 at least, not by themselves.  One of the biggest reasons why IoT projects fail is because line of business expectations aren\xe2\x80\x99t managed correctly, or because IT and OT didn\xe2\x80\x99t work together to validate if a solution is feasible with current technology and skill sets.\nThe IoT tech stack is complex and fragmented. Organizations have to pick the right sensors, select the machines to be connected, choose a connectivity method, and then build the networking, application, and business intelligence layers (often incorporating cloud and multiple applications) on top. To further complicate matters, companies are looking to connect many different (often legacy) machines that have never before been connected. Different protocols must be parsed and cleaned up so that technologies further up the stack can ingest and understand the data.\nNo single department is capable of navigating all the different technical options and making the best decisions for a seamless, secure IoT deployment. While OT may be able to choose sensors and machines to connect, and IT may be able to build the remainder of the tech stack, these decisions can\xe2\x80\x99t be made in silos. The digitalization of machine data creates a technical convergence, and both sides must work together to make IoT work. IoT is a team sport.\nWhen the right people come together to solve a business problem with IoT, it becomes much easier to build a successful solution. Four primary groups or individuals include:\nThe line of business:\nRepresentatives from lines of business can articulate the business need. These people are experts in higher level business strategy, sales, marketing, how to go to market, etc. For the line of business, IoT is a means to an end to achieve a business objective. These people can envision the dashboard and contribute to process and organizational design. While they may or may not own the budget, the line of business defines and creates the demand for a business improvement.\nIT department:\nThe IT department is responsible for the enterprise IT infrastructure. The department\xe2\x80\x99s main concerns are security, scalability, and manageability. They work in a fast, dynamic environment. IT is always under pressure to get things done\xe2\x80\x94and to do more with less. When it comes to an IoT deployment, the IT department is concerned with the tech stack from the network out to the edge.\nOT department:\nThe OT department is generally responsible for the equipment on the shop floor. They are concerned about quality, uptime and maintenance of machinery that is typically two to three decades old. Often times, the machines produce data that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere. There\xe2\x80\x99s a human/machine interface where operator receives data and makes decisions. The OT department plays a key role in connecting machinery on the shop floor for an IoT deployment.\nProcurement:\nProcurement is responsible for finding products and services at the best cost. Sometimes this means breaking up solutions and buying components piecemeal. It\xe2\x80\x99s best to bring procurement on board sooner than later so that they understand that the broad spectrum of components in an IoT deployment come from one ecosystem of integration. If a solution is broken up into bits and pieces, none of the solution providers will feel motivated to deliver the best possible service.\nEven with these parties at the decision-making table, there are likely to be gray areas. Organizations often have to experiment or partner with a provider for technology that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the skills to work with internally. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to get the right skills at the right time for the right cost.\nAt Cisco, we work hard to pull together the key technologies and partners required to deliver seamless, secure solutions that span the manufacturing floor to the cloud. Our partner ecosystem consists of large systems integrators, service providers, OT partners, distributors, and a variety of others. We span and bring together both the IT and OT worlds to create harmony and cohesion across our customer\xe2\x80\x99s organization, our Cisco partner ecosystem and through the solution itself via Cisco Validated designs to ensure a successful IoT initiative.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about successful IoT initiatives, read our customer stories.

166,What are your peers reading about? Get insights from our top IoT posts of 2019,Patty Medberry,"b'It seems that every day brings a new development to IoT. Our customers are trying to figure out how new products and new technologies can help their business and overcome the complexities of IoT.  They often tell me that there is so much information out there, that it is difficult to know what or who to pay attention to \xe2\x80\xa6 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I thought it would be interesting to share our top IoT posts from 2019. We have thousands of followers on our blog and case study channels. Their clicks and reads give great insights as to what people care about when it comes to their IoT success. Here they are:\n  An introduction to edge computing and use case examples. What is edge computing, why do businesses need it, and how are they using it? Get answers to these questions and more as Mirko Grabel introduces the concept of edge computing. Also learn how edge computing is being used in the transportation, utilities, and manufacturing industries.\nThe power of intent-based networking for the IoT edge. In January of 2019, Cisco IoT announced new industrial routers and switches that bring intent-based networking to the edge. Vikas Butaney shares how these new products help deploy IoT at scale, all while building in security from the start.\nWhat does 5G look like for Industrial IoT? This a great introduction to the fifth generation of cellular wireless. Patrick Grossetete provides an overview of 5G, its benefits, and use cases. If you\xe2\x80\x99re still hungry for more, download the white paper!\nManufacturing: Secure networks to cell/area zone. As industrial assets connect to the network, security is emerging as concern at the board-of-director level for many manufacturers. In this blog, Paul Didier writes about cybersecurity trends in the manufacturing industry, including attack trends and the development of security standards.\nHow 5G/Wi-Fi 6 will transform multi-access networks in industrial IoT. 5G and Wi-Fi 6 are all the rage these days, but what do they mean for IoT\xe2\x80\x94and especially the industrial IoT? While it\xe2\x80\x99s still early in the game, Patrick Grossetete explains how these technologies will impact IIoT and the benefits organizations can look forward to.\nUnpacking IoT, a series: The complexity challenge and what you can do about it. IoT projects present three distinct challenges for network engineers. Tim Szigeti explains how complexity can derail an IoT project and how to simplify IoT. (Bonus: Read Tim\xe2\x80\x99s other two blog posts on security and scalability.)\nCisco IoT powers reliability with flexible, always-on control for utility customers. Power outages have a far-reaching impact on utility providers and their customers, ranging from increased costs to other project delays. Through Cisco IoT technology, Great River Energy of Minnesota is optimizing service reliability, reducing maintenance costs, and improving operations.\nAs I look at the list above, my biggest surprise is that there were no surprises. Topics like 5G, edge compute, Wi-Fi 6 and just making IoT less complex (among others) are the hot topics that I expected on that list.  And given how fast the market is changing I look forward to seeing how this list will evolve in the upcoming year.\nLearn more about Cisco IoT at www.cisco.com/go/iot.\nShare'",Tags: 5G Cisco IoT edge IIoT Wi-Fi 6,"December 19, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg
167,IIoT security tips and trends for 2020,Marc Blackmer,"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s an exciting time to be in the industrial IoT security space. Having recently joined Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT security business unit as product manager for Cyber Vision, I\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed seeing how the industry has evolved in just the past couple years. Current trends point clearly to opportunities for robust IIoT deployments.\nMarket consolidation\nThe acquisition of companies that offer point products can be considered market validation for a given technology sector. Now is that time for IIoT security, as what was niche becomes mature and more broadly accepted in the market. Cisco has been part of that activity, as we acquired Sentryo last summer. I expect that the industry will see more acquisitions in the coming year.\nWhile M&A activity is a good sign for maturing technologies, it can make security investment decisions challenging for organizations. You want to make sure the technology provider you invest in today will be around tomorrow. Here are a few factors to consider when deciding with whom to invest your time and money:\nCompany stability: Do you have confidence that the company you may invest in will be there three, five, or ten years down the road? How mature and scalable are their product development, professional services, and technical support capabilities? Is that company profitable or is it surviving on venture capital?\nR&D/Investment: Does the company have the resources to invest in innovation while scaling their operations?\nStrategy: What is the company\xe2\x80\x99s strategy over the next one, three, and five years?\nSecurity embedded at the edge\nAt Cisco, we believe security should be at the edge. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the primary reasons why we acquired Sentryo. Sentryo was the only provider in the IoT security market that we felt had a true edge architecture. What do I mean by \xe2\x80\x9cedge architecture\xe2\x80\x9d? It\xe2\x80\x99s putting processing power in devices like routers, switches, and gateways to increase scale, lower costs, and have less impact on the network. And in the industrial space, not burdening those networks is paramount.\nEdge computing isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new concept. Virtualization and containerization make the evolution of security at the edge a natural progression. That\xe2\x80\x99s why our first Cyber Vision hardware sensor uses our IC3000 Industrial Compute platform. And considering a big part of our business is making those edge devices, you can see why Sentryo was the logical choice and how well their model fits with our business. They were the puzzle piece we needed to complete the integrated IIoT cybersecurity, networking, and IT cybersecurity picture.\nAs you plan and execute IoT deployments in 2020, look for ways to leverage edge computing and edge architecture to improve scalability, lower costs, and reduce network impact.\nFrom convergence to collaboration\nWe humans are at our best when we work together and rely on each other\xe2\x80\x99s strengths. It\xe2\x80\x99s very heartening to hear that OT and IT are coming to this conclusion. And as with most human interactions, this is happening through small steps that establish a foundation of trust upon which they can build with each successful interaction. So, if this is so human, where does the technology come in?\nEach group needs both the ability to discover and analyze data points that are relevant to each, and more importantly, to have a mutual understanding of the significance of those analyses to their counterparts. Consider, for example, a scenario where the IT security operations center (SOC) discovers that a device has security vulnerability (CVE) score of 9.2, and that device is part of a mission critical industrial process. The SOC must understand how to communicate that threat to their OT colleagues, and how to best collaborate on the appropriate means of remediation or mitigation. Without this ability, it\xe2\x80\x99s like covering one eye and losing full vision of the situation.\nThe OT/IT convergence won\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight. It will take deliberate effort and hard work from both OT and IT professionals. In the coming year, organizations should look closely at the tools they use and how those tools hinder or help their efforts to align with the other organization.\nSecurity is critical to the success of any IIoT deployment and, fortunately, industry trends point to solid solutions for ensuring that industrial processes are protected. It will be exciting to see how these security solutions enable new IIoT use cases in 2020.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to learn more about how Cisco approaches IoT security, visit us online or contact your local sales team or partner. You can also visit us at S4x20 in Miami in January.

168,A tale of a modern city,Arik Elberse,"b'Working with cities across the world, we\xe2\x80\x99ve started to notice a familiar pattern of challenges and we believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with a solution and unique innovations to address these. So, in the story below I\xe2\x80\x99d like to share the perspective of a typical municipal leader who\xe2\x80\x99s facing these challenges and how Cisco can help. Perhaps this tale will be familiar to you; and who knows, maybe Cisco can help you modernize your city like we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with countless others.\n* * *\nThe mayor had announced a plan to make our city smart \xe2\x80\x93 starting with using IoT technologies to monitor and improve traffic flow. I understood the potential value, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure how we would get there.\nMy mind wandered to a number of incidents that had shown the shortcomings of our current network. For one thing, I remembered the time a traffic crew went out for routine maintenance at 5th and Maple Streets. Who knows why they needed to pull some of the Ethernet cables, but what a mess they made putting them back into different positions! Everything stopped working: no more cameras, and traffic optimizations stopped working, which affected traffic across the whole region. It took us two days to track down the root cause because we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the right wiring diagram records. And the time it took to reverse engineer the IT setup? That was a nightmare.\nAnother time, a savvy school kid wired up an illegal Wi-Fi access point by simply jimmying open a street cabinet and plugging into one of our switches. He would have gotten away with it a lot longer, too, if a road maintenance crew hadn\xe2\x80\x99t accidentally dug up the fiber optic for that cabinet, requiring someone to go out and take a look. (Of course, we were lucky the kid only wanted free Internet access; otherwise, we might have ended up like the billboard on I-75 in Auburn Hills, Michigan with nefarious content on our variable message signs.)\nTo truly modernize and connect our community, we would need better connectivity at our intersections, more cameras, more sensors and new public Wi-Fi services. This would also enable wireless broadband services for lower-income citizens \xe2\x80\x93 giving that school kid what he wanted all along! And I knew that investment would also help us prepare for future connected and autonomous vehicles.\nUltimately, for security, we had known what we needed all along: much more detailed security policies and configurations plus well-defined access control lists (ACLs) on every switch, in every cabinet and in every junction; all linked up, coordinated and managed back to a set of virtual local area networks (VLANs). We\xe2\x80\x99d also need strict control over which devices plug into which switch ports and maybe even MAC address authentication of every device plugged in (although MAC addresses can be spoofed, too).\nThe challenge? It would be a Herculean task just to do the security design, even more difficult to implement and pretty much impossible to maintain. The odds that some device in a street cabinet switch would be misconfigured weren\xe2\x80\x99t just astronomically high. It was inevitable. And when it happened, things would stop working. Even if we wanted to take on this mammoth task, who would do the work? We were not staffed for that type of complexity. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the necessary IT and security skillsets and expertise, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to find and acquire that talent.\nA design tailor-made for connected communities\nI guess that\xe2\x80\x99s why I was so fascinated (and grateful) to meet Sam, the Cisco account manager who told me about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Intent-based Networking and their fully validated solution called Connected Communities Infrastructure. It seemed tailor-made to address our issues. I was skeptical at first, but in the follow-up meeting with Sam\xe2\x80\x99s sales engineer, we all started to see the power of network automation, centralized policy for security consistency and simplicity, and analytics to tell us when there is unexpected activity or behavior on the network.\nWhat really blew us away was Software-Defined Access (SDA). It would let us take security to the next level while using a single physical infrastructure for multiple services and departments \xe2\x80\x93 each with their own dedicated virtual network. With no more manually configured and maintained per-box ACLs, we could tap into the power of those best practices but with the simplicity of administering and automating it all centrally from Cisco DNA Center. We also felt more confident knowing that Cisco already tested all these capabilities specifically for our Smart City and Connected Roadways use cases and documented all the best practices and design guidance in the Connected Communities Infrastructure CVD (Cisco Validated Design). Of course, the overall project effort was still significant. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy coordinating so many new systems, sensors and devices, but we had a good partner who managed that for us.\nConnectivity that\xe2\x80\x99s simple AND secure\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re now rolling out a true next-generation network with the security and flexibility we need for the future. And while we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it all with our original staff, we\xe2\x80\x99re also able to do so much more. We can now provision virtual network connectivity and services for other departments, leveraging their budgets to continue expanding our network and capabilities. We did this recently when we enabled (all in software!) a new virtual network on our public Wi-Fi access points to enable the police to automatically and instantly upload their police body camera footage to a secure central location. Looking ahead, when we need to roll out a network or services upgrade, the task will be much simpler. Take, for example, that intersection at 5th and Maple that used to give us such headaches. We\xe2\x80\x99re now installing a new traffic management system with traffic and pedestrian sensors, variable message signs, environmental sensors and public Wi-Fi services. We\xe2\x80\x99re even planning to test vehicle-to-infrastructure communications like DSRC/ITS-G5/C-ITS and integrate this with our new traffic management system.\nWhat truly amazed me, however, was how straightforward network connectivity proved to be. Our engineer simply took two new Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Ethernet switches to the site. There he unboxed them, fitted accessories like SPF connectors for the fiber, hooked up power, connected the street fiber and clipped the switch to the street cabinet\xe2\x80\x99s DIN rail. Straight away we saw the box come up in Cisco DNA Center back in our control center. At a push of a button, that new street-side Ethernet switch was configured \xe2\x80\x93 and secured!\nIn fact, our engineer plugged in his laptop thinking he could check for connectivity, but straightaway it flagged a warning on our system and isolated his network connection and laptop. We actually laughed when he called and said the switch wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working and that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even getting an IP address! Just to show him the power of this new Intent-based Network, we instantly took his isolated connection and laptop and gave him full Internet access. He quickly said, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, it\xe2\x80\x99s working now. Did you guys do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Then we turned it off again just to show him.\nThe rest was equally straightforward: The engineer plugged in the traffic control system, cameras, sensors and Wi-Fi access points. The cameras, Wi-Fi access points and some of the sensors run on Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t even need any other cabling or separate power. Each device authenticated with the network using well-established, secure protocols, such as 802.1x and MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB). One by one, they got the connectivity and network services they needed and were assigned to. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter which connections went into which ports on the IE3400, as each port auto-configured based on the devices\xe2\x80\x99 authentication. Even when the engineer swapped some Ethernet cables to tidy up the wiring, the system automatically and securely re-configured the ports. It just WORKS.\nWe had never seen anything like it. Our city \xe2\x80\x93 and our network \xe2\x80\x93 are truly \xe2\x80\x9csmart,\xe2\x80\x9d and we can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine ever returning to per-box configurations and ACLs.\n* * *\nReady to write a similar tale for your own city?

169,"Unpacking IoT, a series: The complexity challenge and what you can do about it",Tim Szigeti,"b'In my previous two blog posts, I explained how Cisco addresses the security and scalability challenges associated with an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment. In this post, I cover the final of the top three challenges: complexity. For an IoT initiative to be successful, the deployment and management of connected devices must be made simplified.\nThe typical solution to address scalability is automation. Automation certainly helps expedite and scale out an IoT deployment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough. If you cut and paste, and deploy text-based device configurations, that will help speed up configuration, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t simplify deployments. A network administrator still has to come up with an appropriate network configuration to meet the business needs, perform extensive testing and validation of these configurations on a platform-by-platform and software-image by software-image basis, and finally templatize these configurations to support device-specific variables (like device names, discrete interface IP addresses, location details, etc.). So, how do we make this entire process easier beyond just automation?\nTo simplify IoT deployments, Cisco has made a paradigm shift in terms of how we empower network operators to program network devices. This new approach is called intent-based networking. To realize the impact of this new way of thinking, you need to understand that there are essentially two main ways to \xe2\x80\x9cprogram\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 that is, to provide a set of instructions. One way is called the imperative model and the other is called the declarative model. Any programmable thing \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a computer or a person being given instructions \xe2\x80\x94 can be programmed using one of these models. The best way to explain the difference between the two models is to use a simple analogy.\nImagine you\xe2\x80\x99re taking a taxicab to the airport. One way you can ensure you get to your destination is by providing the driver explicit turn-by-turn directions: turn left at the first signal, go down three blocks, turn right on Main Street, etc. You break everything down into discrete, very easy to follow directions, but they\xe2\x80\x99re very complex. This approach illustrates the imperative model of programming, where every instruction needs to be provided in detail. Additionally, it should be noted that the imperative approach may even be sub-optimal and inflexible. For example, what if a particular street was closed for repairs and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to detour around the affected area?\nAn alternative approach, the declarative model, is to leverage the knowledge of the taxi driver and simply declare your intent: take me to the airport. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to explain how to get there or which route to take. You just express your intent \xe2\x80\x94 the business result that you want to achieve \xe2\x80\x94 and then rely on the driver to deliver on that intent. This is the paradigm shift we made at Cisco and what intent-based networking is all about.\n  Intent-based networking for IoT\nCisco DNA Center is the equivalent of that cab driver who knows how to get you from point A to point B without detailed instructions. We\xe2\x80\x99ve embedded 30 years of networking knowledge into our solutions, enabling network operators to express their intent at the business level. For example, in the case of network security policies, a network operator can indicate these devices can talk to those devices. These people can access thoseapplications. That\xe2\x80\x99s business-level intent. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to specify all the rules of how that intent is delivered, which technology is utilized, what kind of access policy is applied, where it\xe2\x80\x99s deployed, etc. The network operator allows the machine to translate that and then to scale that configuration using automation to the programmable physical and virtual network infrastructures.\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not all. We close the loop by soliciting telemetry data from the infrastructure to confirm that indeed the stated intent was delivered. The system compares the data from the network with what was declared by the operator to make sure that the business intent is being delivered. Either it is, and you have confirmation and data to that effect. Or, it\xe2\x80\x99s not and that\xe2\x80\x99s very important to know because then you can launch a troubleshooting workflow to investigate the root cause and take remedial action.\nIntent-based networking is not new. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing it within our data center with our application-centric infrastructure for quite a few years now, and more recently in the past five years we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing it in our enterprise networking. The expression of that is Cisco DNA Center.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s important now is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve extended intent-based networking capabilities to the IoT edge. All IoT switches, routers, and wireless access points that run Cisco IOS XE can be managed by the same pane of glass you use to manage the rest of your network via DNA Center. Furthermore, you can extend the enterprise network to your IoT edge \xe2\x80\x94 wherever that happens to be: your parking lots, warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, airports, seaports, utilities, power grids, etc. All of these places can be extended to using the same toolset.\nThe result: one intent-based network architecture for a consistent end-to-end experience and one set of security policies. IoT deployment is simplified, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also scalable and secure.\nWant to learn more?

170,How IoT is addressing security threats in oil and gas,Jason Greengrass,"b'It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to imagine the havoc a physical attack on an oil and gas operation can wreak. But few pause to consider the extent of damage that can be achieved with cyberattacks alone. Be it malware taking over control systems or ransomware shutting down data access, the consequences of cyberattacks are often on par with those of physical attacks, with similar implications. In other industries, cyberattacks may threaten customers\xe2\x80\x99 personal information and negatively impact a company\xe2\x80\x99s compliance and reputation. In oil and gas, it\xe2\x80\x99s people\xe2\x80\x99s lives \xe2\x80\x93 and the environment itself \xe2\x80\x93 that are at stake.\nPhysical AND digital threats are on the rise, making security an increasingly important priority for virtually every company. One of the biggest threat drivers for oil and gas? The growing universe of connected \xe2\x80\x9cthings\xe2\x80\x9d being deployed upstream, midstream, and downstream in the refinery and beyond.\nFrom a security standpoint, IoT devices in oil and gas can be both a blessing and curse. They collect a wealth of real-time, real-world data that can be crucial to achieving goals around improving operational efficiency, optimizing equipment operation and maintenance, safeguarding workers, and addressing compliance requirements. Connected cameras, geo-fencing perimeter protection solutions, third-party intrusion, and other access control capabilities can even play a vital role in physical security protecting physical infrastructure.\nCommercial off-the-shelf products are increasingly seen in oil and gas to perform tasks that were originally undertaken by purpose-built equipment for the operational environment. They come with more potential vulnerabilities, and therefore greater security risk, compared to traditional process control systems. By their very existence, they also dramatically increase the size of the potential attack surface.\nAlongside those challenges are the vast volumes of data that so many interconnected devices and sensors generate. Just as oil and gas move through a pipeline, so does data. Beyond protecting the physical security of oil fields, refineries, and distribution channels, companies must ensure that the data pipeline is secure upstream, midstream, and downstream.\nPut it all together and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that oil and gas companies must think about security not in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cdigital\xe2\x80\x9d but rather from end-to-end, with a corresponding plan, and ongoing monitoring and management. This approach needs to unify everyone in the value chain \xe2\x80\x93 suppliers, partners and even customers \xe2\x80\x93 around a singular, standards-based security framework.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the best way for oil and gas companies to begin their journey toward comprehensive security? Lead with a baseline assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s currently connected (and what needs to be connected) in each environment. Use that to gain visibility to all assets and to measure associated risks. With that level of insight, start segmenting the environments to reduce the size of attack surfaces. Develop and apply consistent security policies to each segment. And then review the assessment regularly \xe2\x80\x93 making updates to reflect new equipment, new threats, and other opportunities to drive business value.\nIt may be not be possible to eradicate all security threats, but oil and gas companies can take proactive steps to fuel smarter, more effective protection. Cisco is here to help.\nLearn more about our IoT security offerings here\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Internet of Things Cisco IoT cyberattacks IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) Oil and Gas refinery security,"December 5, 2019",https://alln-extcloud-storage.cisco.com/Cisco_Blogs:blogs/1/2019/12/Jason-Greengrass-e1575507160348-150x150.jpg
171,"Unpacking IoT, a series: The scalability challenge and what you can do about it",Tim Szigeti,"b'The Internet of Things (IoT) presents a number of challenges for network engineers. In my previous post, I explained how Cisco is helping to address the biggest IoT challenge by far: security. In this post, we\xe2\x80\x99ll cover the next challenge: scalability.\nAs shown in the figure below, tens of billions of devices are coming online within the next few years, which presents tremendous IoT scalability concerns.\nHow can organizations possibly scale security and network policies to address all of these devices? If we have to configure IoT devices the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve configured network devices for the last couple decades, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to meet the scalability requirements that IoT is driving. The \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d way \xe2\x80\x93 manual, box-by-box configuration \xe2\x80\x93 is slow and prone to errors.\nThe answer? Automation. Deploying policies at scale using automation speeds up provisioning and makes software management far easier. This can be achieved with software-defined access.\nUnder the hood: Scaling IoT in Cisco DNA Center\nAllow me to explain. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you want to apply a network policy to your IoT devices. All of the IoT devices must be on their own VLAN, separate from the rest of the devices on the network. The objective being to prevent an attacker from using an IoT device as a toehold into the rest of the enterprise network.\nWith Cisco DNA Center, adding a new virtual network is as simple as naming the network and selecting which groups of users, devices, and/or applications should be on it. These are represented as Scalable Groups. The network operator selects each of the groups that belong on the new virtual network by simply dragging and dropping the appropriate icons from the left to the right side of the screen and clicking save. With just a few clicks, IoT devices are effectively segmented so that they can only communicate with the other devices as specified in the virtual network. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to assign VLANs and DHCP scopes, program ACLs, etc. \xe2\x80\x93 as a network operator, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to speak the language of networking policies and access control lists to nearly instantly create your network.\nThe Scalable Group Tag (SGT) is what makes this process so easy. A Scalable Group is a logical policy object to \xe2\x80\x9cgroup\xe2\x80\x9d users and/or devices. The SGT identifies anything that you want to apply a policy to: endpoints, users, or applications. SGTs are used to manage IP address-independent \xe2\x80\x9cGroup Based Policies.\xe2\x80\x9d That means policies are applied to the Scalable Group, instead of individual IP addresses. In the past, network operators would often apply policies to device IP addresses because they are ubiquitous, end-to-end and consistent, but that approach gets messy. By applying policies primarily to the SGT, in addition to the segmentation of the virtual networks, you can be scalable, effective, and flexible in policy expressions on software-defined access networks for IoT.\nThe process above is the same process used to manage devices on the enterprise network. IoT devices, however, don\xe2\x80\x99t typically have all the higher capabilities and compute resources as, say, switches in a data center. They\xe2\x80\x99re typically lighter in weight and have a smaller form factor, lower power draw, and smaller hardware capabilities.\nIn order to play in this software-defined world, we need to adapt and reconcile these two constraints: one of providing segmentation and policy, the other of allowing the hardware to remain as lightweight as possible. This is where Cisco Software Defined Access Extended Nodes come in. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how they work:\nExtended node connects to a single Edge node using an 802.1Q Trunk port (single or multiple VLANs) using static assignment\nSwitchports on the Extended node can then be statically assigned to an appropriate IP Pool in Cisco DNA Center\nSGT mapping is accomplished by Pool to Group mapping in Cisco DNA Center on the connected Edge node\nTraffic policy enforcement based on Scalable Group ACLs is performed at the Edge node\nScaling enterprise networks was hard enough when network operators had to manually configure individual boxes. It\xe2\x80\x99s downright near impossible with IoT. Fortunately, Cisco has solved this challenge in enterprise networks using software defined access and automation. And now those same solutions can be applied to IoT. With Cisco as your partner, you can scale efficiently and effectively using the same management interface you use for the enterprise network.\nWant to learn more?

172,Cisco and Honeywell team up to deliver wireless capabilities to hazardous environments,Henry Teichert,"b'When we talk to our customers, one of the biggest challenges they face is keeping their employees safe. For example, workers often need to enter the most dangerous corners of oil refineries and other traditionally hazardous locations to perform manual tasks, such as taking meter readings from equipment.\nThis can put them at risk of exposure to chemical leaks or other dangers in order to perform these duties. A not only perilous, but also very time-consuming process.\nBut with the right connectivity capabilities, chemical process manufacturers and others can deploy reliable data collection solutions without putting their workers at risk.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we are excited to share that Honeywell is developing a OneWireless\xe2\x84\xa2 IoT module for our next-generation Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points.\nTo give an example of the many benefits this solution delivers, workers can now collect and respond to critical plant data in real-time from anywhere throughout the plant, instead of having to manually monitor the information. This helps the workers increase productivity while keeping them out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\nThe Honeywell OneWireless IoT Module will deliver ISA100 Wireless and WirelessHART multi-protocol support, extending the connectivity delivered by our new Class I, Division 2 certified Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Access Point to plant sensors, cameras, and other instrumentation. This joint wireless solution will enable customers to deploy wireless technologies in hazardous locations as an extension of their distributed control system, enabling the integration of disparate data for more proactive, efficient and responsive operations.\nBut the benefits don\xe2\x80\x99t end there. The Cisco and Honeywell integrated solution supports a wide range of industrial applications, such as location tracking of people and assets, connectivity to security cameras and more.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor years, Honeywell OneWireless customers have benefited from our unique approach to delivering multi-protocol wireless connectivity for both workers and field instrumentation in the most challenging process manufacturing environments.

173,Smart Cities: Accelerating the Path to Digital Transformation,Qiang Huang,"b'Cities around the world face rapid urbanization, economic constraints, and environmental concerns. To address these challenges, city administrators are turning to technology, especially the Internet of Things (IoT), to digitize city operations. Unfortunately, smart city technologies pose significant challenges of their own.\nSmart city IoT services include smart lighting, smart parking, intelligent traffic management systems, smart waste management, video surveillance with analytics, and real-time monitoring of pollution and air quality. They can help make cities more accessible, safer, greener, and liveable. However, before cities can realize these benefits, they must first overcome the following hurdles:\nSelecting technologies from a plethora of options, including upcoming 5G choices\nNavigating complexities of deploying and managing multiple technologies\nEnsuring cybersecurity, secure data management, and regulatory compliance\nMaintaining SLAs on existing services while quickly innovating and delivering new services\nDeriving value from the vast volumes of new city data\nUnable to overcome these challenges, cities often implement projects as one-offs or proofs of concepts without a holistic architecture. In fact, smart city solutions often come with their own networking and application infrastructure. This siloed approach leads to fragmented, sub-scale deployments that are difficult to maintain and secure \xe2\x80\x94 never mind share data, align policies, and deploy new services.\nHow to overcome smart city challenges\nHundreds of cities, however, are overcoming the challenges associated with smart city deployments. By partnering with Cisco, the market leader in IT and security, these cities can move beyond siloed proofs of concepts and accelerate their smart city journeys.\nCisco offers a proven approach for smart city success:\nA comprehensive multi-service IoT network and security architecture called Cisco Connected Communities Infrastructure (CCI)\nCisco Kinetic for Cities (CKC), a smart city platform to aggregate and normalize data from multiple use cases with pre-integration to a broad ecosystem of sensor and application partners\nCCI enables customers to leverage next-generation intent-based networking technology, which simplifies deployment, management, and security for a scalable and flexible smart city network. CCI\xe2\x80\x99s modular architecture allows customers to choose from multi-access communication technologies, including fiber, Ethernet with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), Wi-Fi, Wi-SUN, LoRaWAN, and DSRC/ITS-G5 vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Using Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Software Defined Access (SDA), cities can sub-divide a CCI network into multiple virtual networks and thereby securely operate multiple services across various city departments. Customers like the City of Schenectady, NY; and the Town of Cary, NC are deploying their projects with confidence, knowing that CCI is a Cisco Validated Design (CVD) with a clearly documented architecture blueprint and design best practices that are tested by Cisco engineers. (Learn more about CCI.)\nOpen, industry standards are critical for customers to enable multi-service networks and avoid vendor lock-in. Cisco continues to move CCI and our ecosystem towards relevant industry standards and interoperability. The most recent example is our partner CIMCON Lighting and their newly certified Wi-SUN Smart Street Lighting solution.\nWi-SUN is an IEEE 802.15-based mesh technology that enables multiple services, such as lighting and metering. As an active member of the Wi-SUN Alliance, Cisco helped to define this open-standard for multi-vendor interoperability. Last year, we announced Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s support of the Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) Certification Program, and as part of this we offer a hardware Reference Design and SDK. CIMCON and other partners are using these resources to build their Wi-SUN stack and accelerate certification, thus enabling multi-vendor interoperability. For example, BHIP in Brazil recently deployed 30,000 CIMCON streetlight controllers on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s mesh network leveraging the CCI architecture, with a vision to add new services and smart devices in the future. The ability to adopt Wi-SUN helps to move them in this direction.\nAccessing data and achieving interoperability from various smart city IoT services are also critical steps on any digital transformation journey. Otherwise, data remains locked in siloes, making it difficult and expensive to develop smart city applications. Unfortunately, the smart city market is still young and lacks standard data models for sensors and applications. Cisco Kinetic for Cities addresses this and reduces deployment complexity by normalizing data to consistent, well-defined data models by integrating an ecosystem of over 90 pre-integrated partners. This allows CKC to bring multiple services and vendors together in a single-pane-of-glass dashboard to enable better operation and smarter correlated policies. We also offer a series of CKC API training modules and CKC sandbox on Cisco DevNet where cities can join or leverage over 600,000 Cisco developers to develop new applications and services.\nAt Cisco, we believe smart city technologies must be secure, scalable, and interoperable \xe2\x80\x94 not just to meet today\xe2\x80\x99s needs, but also to enable cities to undergo a sustainable journey towards digital transformation. This means strategically planning your city\xe2\x80\x99s communications network and adopting next-generation capabilities embodied in Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Communities Infrastructure. It also means leveraging industry standards and interoperability across a partner ecosystem. That security, scalability, and interoperability can also be extended to your city data with the Cisco Kinetic for Cities platform.\nTo learn more about how Cisco is helping smart cities, visit our booth at Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona, Spain November 19-21, or visit us on the web.\nShare'",Tags: #Security 5G analytics Cisco IoT Cisco Validated Design (CVD) Connected Roadways Cybersecurity data management Digital transformation digitization Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Cities smart parking smart waste management,"November 20, 2019",https://alln-extcloud-storage.cisco.com/Cisco_Blogs:blogs/blogs.cisco.com/2019/11/qhuang-150x150.jpg
174,Manufacturing: Secure networks to cell/area zone,Paul Didier,"b'Strictly speaking, threats to manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 security isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new phenomenon. For several years, factories have fallen prey to security breaches \xe2\x80\x93 experiencing everything from brief production disruptions to significant business impacts. Known incidents in 2017 cost manufacturers more than $10 billion in reported losses. Not surprisingly, security has emerged as a board-level concern for nearly every manufacturing company.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s changing today is the intentionality behind attacks against manufacturers. In the past, many breaches occurred almost by accident due to benign neglect \xe2\x80\x93 unpatched software, a server left untended. Today, however, threats are very much on purpose. Attackers are far more nefarious. And as manufacturers increasingly connect equipment, devices and sensors throughout their production environments, attackers can pursue a much larger potential surface.\nUnderstandably, manufacturers prefer to keep security attacks and other incidents close to the vest. Fortunately, they\xe2\x80\x99re much more willing to talk about strategies for improving cyber security \xe2\x80\x93 and many are collaborating on the creation and refinement of formal standards for securing industrial automation and control systems.\nCisco is proud to be part of that effort, including helping shape the global Industrial Network and Security standards (ISA/IEC 62443) as well as offering some of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first products that meet those standards. We\xe2\x80\x99re also collaborating with ODVA and others to create some of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s best cyber security support in industrial protocol standards. We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged to see initial products coming out that support CIP security \xe2\x80\x93 that is, the ability to create segmentation at the application layer, which complements the strong cyber security capabilities Cisco delivers at the network level.\nOver the past year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve introduced a number of security innovations in our industrial automation solutions, including cell/area zone security, which applies our software-defined segmentation (a.k.a. TrustSec model) to this critical area of industrial systems. It delivers greater visibility to the industrial devices and communication on the network. That makes it possible to know who\xe2\x80\x99s talking to whom and, over time, to build and enforce an industrial security policy model that integrates IT and OT technologies and teams. The solution uses a combination of our industrial networking platform (IE switches), OT network management (IND), IT-leading Identity and Access Management (ISE) and Visibility and Security Analytics (Stealthwatch) applications. The result significantly improves cyber security protections for vulnerable industrial automation and control systems.\nThese solution enhancements are just the tip of the iceberg regarding Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to industrial security. In August, Cisco completed the acquisition of Sentryo \xe2\x80\x93 a France-based company that provides asset visibility and cyber security solutions for industrial control systems. Because security will always be top of mind for our customers, Cisco IoT will continue to build and deliver certified products that address manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 security needs.\nCyber security for industrial systems is now a board-level concern for manufacturers. Our solutions combine our #1 cyber security technology with our #1 industrial networking portfolio to deliver significantly improved visibility and protection of mission-critical industrial applications \xe2\x80\x93 a key step to actively alleviate those board-level concerns \xe2\x80\x93 starting today. Check out our solutions and then reach out to our sales team and/or partners to start a proof of concept with the confidence of a Cisco Validated Design to guide you.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco IoT IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) IT Manufacturing OT SecureManufacturing security,"November 19, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192415-padidier-1-150x150.jpg
175,"Unpacking IoT, a series: The security challenge and what you can do about it",Tim Szigeti,"b'Network engineers face a number of challenges when deploying Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives. Come back to the Cisco IoT blog over the next few weeks as we dive into the top three IoT challenges, and best practices for conquering them.\nFirst up, the biggest challenge in IoT by a longshot: security.\nIoT security threats differ significantly from security threats in traditional IT environments: in traditional IT, security concerns are focused first and foremost on protecting data. Attackers can steal data, compromise data, and hold it ransom. Recently, they are just as interested in stealing compute power for malicious cryptomining activities.\nWhile these security concerns exist in IoT, they also go further, extending beyond the data and into the physical world. At minimum, an IoT security incident can inconvenience people or interrupt operations, causing millions of dollars of damage within a few short hours. At worst, these attacks can damage systems that control a physical process and even put lives at risk. Consider the following examples:\nThe infamous Stuxnet attack in 2010 leveraged multiple zero-day flaws in Microsoft Windows software. The objective was to detect and corrupt PLCs running Siemen\xe2\x80\x99s Step7 software so as to reprogram these with malware to cause the fast-spinning nuclear centrifuges under their control to literally tear themselves apart. The end result of this attack saw one-fifth of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear centrifuges destroyed.\nWe saw the first successful cyberattack on a power grid in 2015 when cyberattackers gained control of multiple Ukrainian power stations, resulting in the loss of electricity to over 225,000 residents for periods of up to six hours. This complex and multi-phased attack not only gained control of SCADA systems, allowing foreign actors to remotely switch off substations, but also included a DoS attack on the call center so that consumers were unable to call in to report issues or to receive updates of the status of the blackout.\nIn 2017, an attacker deployed ICS malware, dubbed Triton, designed to manipulate industrial safety systems so as to cause operational disruption of critical infrastructure. The attacker\xe2\x80\x99s specific targeting of the Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) suggest an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical consequences (an attack objective not typically seen from cybercrime groups). Analysis of the incident lead the investigators to believe this was the work of a nation-state preparing for a broader attack.\nIn 2019, a ransomware attack on Norsk Hydro, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest manufacturers of aluminum, forced the company to switch to manual operations in a bid to contain the breach. The attack cost the company $52M and resulted in a worldwide increase of the price of aluminum.\nThese incidents show how critical\xe2\x80\x94and challenging\xe2\x80\x94security can be in IoT scenarios.\nPreventing and Containing IoT Security Threats\nIn the examples above, security breaches could have been prevented entirely\xe2\x80\x94or, at the least, significantly contained\xe2\x80\x94using a network security best practice: segmentation. Segmentation is one of the most effective network design principles to deploy for security. It\xe2\x80\x99s a universally accepted networking axiom \xe2\x80\x93 but if so, why don\xe2\x80\x99t organizations fully segment their networks?\nThe answer: it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\nTo reduce costs, organizations have converged their data, voice, and video networks onto a shared physical infrastructure. More recently, IoT devices have also been added to the same IP network. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to maintain logical separation between these services for security and management purposes. To do so, network engineers typically segment the network using VLANs. This process requires multiple steps, touchpoints, policies, and user interfaces. At a high level, network engineers must create groups in Active Directory, define policies, execute VLANs/subnets, and implement the policy.\nThe complex nature of segmentation not only makes the task a tedious one, it also increases the risk of human error. For example, access control lists (ACLs) on network devices are often tens of thousands of lines long. They are difficult to manage and understand due to poorly documented reasons for each line in the entry. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one discrepancy for ACLs from one device to another, there\xe2\x80\x99s a potential vulnerability and an attack vector that can be exploited.\nBringing Cisco Security to IoT\nGiven the key role network segmentation plays in protecting network assets, it\xe2\x80\x99s critical that network administrators can segment the network efficiently and effectively. At Cisco, we simplify segmentation by applying intent-based networking to the enterprise network. This specific expression of intent-based networking is called Software Defined Access (SDA).\nSoftware Defined Access eliminates the need for network administrators to speak the language of access control lists or group policies in order to identify which network devices can talk to each other. With a few simple clicks and drag-and-drops of the mouse, network administrators can establish separate virtual networks for voice, data, guest access wireless, BYOD, IoT, and more. This year, we extended these capabilities all the way to the IoT edge \xe2\x80\x94 so that parking lots, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, airports, seaports, etc. can all be managed from the same single pane of glass as the carpeted enterprise, namely Cisco DNA Center.\nUsing Cisco DNA Center, a centralized management dashboard, network administrators can provision networks across the enterprise and ensure that devices assigned to one virtual network can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to the devices on another virtual network. In fact, the devices on one virtual network can\xe2\x80\x99t even see the other virtual networks. As far as they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned, the virtual network they are connected to is the one and only network that exists or that has ever existed. That means IoT devices assigned to an IoT virtual network can only communicate with other devices assigned to the same virtual network and nothing (and no one) else. Such logical separation is called macro-segmentation.\nHowever, SDA offers an even more granular policy option to network administrators.\nIn macro segmentation, any device within a virtual network can by default talk to any other device in that same virtual network. So, if video cameras, temperature sensors, and badge readers all assigned to a single \xe2\x80\x9cIoT Virtual Network\xe2\x80\x9d, these devices \xe2\x80\x93 by default \xe2\x80\x93 would be able to communicate with each other. Such communication can present a security issue \xe2\x80\x93 If a single device is compromised, attackers will use that device to scan the network for other devices that may provide a further foothold into the organization (Watch how this is done). That\xe2\x80\x99s where micro-segmentation comes in.\nIn Cisco DNA Center, network administrators can easily create micro-segmentation policies that define which devices can speak to other devices within the same virtual network. (Watch the demo, Cisco Extended Enterprise with DNA-C.) Administrators can also configure the policy to send an alert if those devices attempt to communicate with unauthorized devices, which could be indicative of a potential security attack. In our example above, video cameras can be configured to speak only to other video cameras, and if they try to speak to the temperature sensors or badge readers, an alert will be issued.\nThe ability to segment the network on both a macro and micro level with SDA is a great solution to both preventing and containing a security breach. It easily scales to address the needs of the enterprise network and now Cisco customers can apply these same concepts to their IoT networks. Furthermore, they can do so efficiently and effectively using the same management interface they use for the enterprise network. Want to learn more?

176,Can manufacturing go wireless in a 5G/Wi-Fi 6 world?,Russ Gyurek,"b'With the recent availability of Wi-Fi 6 solutions, the launch of 5G pilot projects and new shared license spectrum policies, many are wondering: Can manufacturing go further down the wireless path? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that there are numerous nuances and complications related to the \xe2\x80\x9cwhen,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cat what cost\xe2\x80\x9d of implementing wireless in manufacturing.\nFor starters, the manufacturing industry relies on equipment with an expected lifecycle of at least 10 to 15 years. Approximately 80 percent of current factory connectivity is wired. While there is the capability to upgrade from Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi 6 and backwards compatibility, 5G is not as simple a matter. Therefore, 5G upgrades will occur over an extended period as technology investments are refreshed or replaced. 5G user equipment for factories is not readily available at this point since the market is early and standards are still evolving.\nFor factories, key use cases include mobile workforce, Remote Expert tied to secure plant equipment, workforce location tracking, asset location tracking, wireless machine instrumentation, autonomous vehicles and mobile machines, physical security, workflow optimization and wireless sensification. Other use cases will most likely emerge related to robotics, AR/VR, digital twins and more.\nThe needs for these various use cases vary in terms of determinism, latency and throughput. One of the top areas of focus in wireless is meeting the low-latency capabilities traditionally tied to wired connectivity and defined by IEEE 802.1Q. Time-Sensitive networking (TSN) or 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) is tied to applications requiring very low latency from 1 to 10 milliseconds (for example, automation and control systems). To meet the lowest latency provided by TSN of 1 millisecond is very challenging for wireless technologies. There is significant effort in organizations such as 3GPP and 5G-ACIA towards this capability.\nAnother factor is a factory\xe2\x80\x99s geographical location. The top 10 industrial countries are progressively moving to some type of dedicated spectrum that could support industrial and similar vertical needs. In Germany, for example, companies can bid on and secure private LTE/5G spectrum in 10Mhz blocks for 10-year periods with a renewal option. In a recent announcement, a major German automaker stated that it will run its own 5G network in its factories. With dedicated spectrum, industrial companies can choose between maintaining full control of their network or engaging a service provider to implement and run 5G.\nAnother option is shared spectrum, such as Citizens Band Radio System (CBRS) in the U.S. CBRS has three user levels: incumbents, priority access licenses (PALs) and general authorization access (GAA). Note that the CBRS is shared, so there is the potential to have service/spectrum interruptions from the incumbents (the US Navy) or PAL users if you are GAA. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, building out a 5G network requires an investment in new radio (NRs), network interface cards (NICs) and end-equipment or network-equipment adaptors.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\xe2\x80\x9d of wireless deployment depends on use case(s) and network needs, as well as cost of ownership and service-plan availability of spectrum or SP services to support QoS requirements as a network 5G \xe2\x80\x9cslice\xe2\x80\x9d or dedicated 5G spectrum.\nFor manufacturers, a multi-access environment \xe2\x80\x93 that is, one combining wired, Bluetooth, LoRa, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, LTE and 5G \xe2\x80\x93 is likely to be the best option. Each offers distinctive advantages depending on the needs and level of control desired. Today, factories are multi-access and will continue to leverage multiple connectivity options into the future.\nBuild or buy?\nBeyond that, manufacturers will face a central question around how to deploy 5G. It\xe2\x80\x99s a variation on the classic build-versus-buy decision: Should a manufacturer secure its own dedicated spectrum and then build and run a private 5G network? Or, should it work with a service provider that can offer the company its own dedicated \xe2\x80\x9cslice\xe2\x80\x9d of spectrum together with network deployment, operations and support services?\nGreater control is the primary benefit of building and maintaining a private network. Among the disadvantages: a steep learning curve of training staff to run a 5G network and the headaches of handling any issues that arise; potentially higher cost for dedicated spectrum 5G equipment; and most likely slower access to the latest-and-greatest features compared to mass-market 5G gear. On the other hand, outsourcing to a service provider will ensure access to the newest technologies while offloading the burdens of day-to-day management but at the cost of losing control of the network.\nFor manufacturers, the best \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x9d will depend on the intended use cases. For most, a multi-access environment \xe2\x80\x93 coupled with a hybrid approach to the 5G network \xe2\x80\x93 could be the best option. There are very different costs and control issues that must be realized in any deployment.\nCosts to consider\nWhen it comes to making investments in 5G and/or Wi-Fi 6, there may be a \xe2\x80\x9cwhich comes first?\xe2\x80\x9d conundrum. As previously noted, most manufacturers are operating factory floors with predominantly hard-wired equipment. Ripping and replacing or retrofitting to go wireless would be a tough case to make as well as a challenge for the OT team. Yet it may also be challenging to justify investments in advanced technologies such as 5G when little or no equipment can make use of these innovations.\nWhile we foresee manufacturers ultimately going wireless, we believe each company will need to develop a long-term roadmap for how it will get there. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to the approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken at Cisco. We have a constantly evolving roadmap to ensure that our customers can make network investments that are safe and future ready. The roadmap can take you from today all the way to 5G and beyond \xe2\x80\x93 helping unlock greater value along the way.\nFor more details on wireless trends and the different phases of technology adoption, see our new white paper, Wi-Fi 6 and Private LTE/5G Technology and Business Models in Industrial IoT or read the Executive Summary to learn more!\nShare'",Tags: 5G Cisco IoT IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) LTE Manufacturing WiFi 6,"November 7, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1573151262-bpfull.jpg
177,How 5G/Wi-Fi 6 will transform multi-access networks in industrial IoT,Patrick Grossetete,"b'The excitement around 5G and Wi-Fi 6 is dominating the news, with  5G networks estimated to be 10 times faster than 4G. While national rollouts are still in infancy, leading service providers say they expect to see more national rollouts in 2020 and shortly thereafter. U.S. service providers are currently in various stages of the 5G rollout, however, 5G services are still limited to selected pilot areas.\nWi-Fi 6 solutions \xe2\x80\x93 the next generation of Wi-Fi \xe2\x80\x93 started to become available earlier this year. And much like 5G, Wi-Fi 6 promises capabilities like faster speeds and lower latency. Although not widely available, devices are already entering the market that will support this new generation (including the Cisco Catalyst 9100 series of access points).\nWhat do 5G and Wi-Fi 6 mean for IoT, especially industrial IoT (IIoT)?\nIn IoT, there is an exponential number of devices that are being connected to a network each and every day. As that massive volume continues to grow, there needs to be a cellular network in place that\xe2\x80\x99s capable of supporting all these devices, while addressing enhancements to contend with low latency.\nFor organizations with digitization initiatives evaluating IoT projects, as well as organizations that are continuing to ramp up their IoT deployments, these devices could be anything from Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Automated Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), robots, or 4K/8K video camera (to name a few). These devices are installed in a variety of industrial locations, which can create additional burdens on the network.\nFor IoT to work in these scenarios, organizations scaling their IoT deployments \xe2\x80\x93 particularly industrial enterprises \xe2\x80\x93 will need to rely on multi-access (i.e. in 3GPP specifications) networks that take advantage of both private LTE, i.e. CBRS, 5G and Wi-Fi 6 technologies depending on the use case. One given technology can\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill all needs \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s considerations of cost, demand, manageability and automation, IP-based industrial networks, and the need to leverage various access and backhaul technologies to meet total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational requirements. The net-net is that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-size-fits-all solution.\nWhen we think about our personal tablet or laptop as an example, consider how much our bill would be if we ran it off a cellular network versus Wi-Fi. Instead of one tablet or laptop, enterprises are connecting thousands of industrial IoT devices that embed Ethernet or Wi-Fi by default and they, too, want to avoid those exorbitant costs. Sure, in some cases it makes sense for the devices to run on private cellular infrastructure (i.e. mining or oil and gas customers connecting remote assets via private LTE to account for a lack of public cellular coverage), but for most, using a combination of cellular data (5G) and wireless (Wi-Fi 6) will reduce overall expenses to connect IoT projects while enhancing the overall throughput and low-latency of the network.\nThis is only the beginning. The future opportunities for 5G and Wi-Fi 6 will continue to grow as standards are established, and as we go from proof of concept to real-world deployments.

178,Cisco empowers IT & OT partners to create and grow their IoT business,Vikas Butaney,"b'Going into Cisco Partner Summit, one thing\xe2\x80\x99s for certain: IoT offers a great opportunity for partners to build profitable, growing practices. Customers are realizing improved efficiencies, reduced costs, downtime and improved safety from their IoT deployments.  And partners are playing a big part in customer success. In fact, partners have been instrumental in scaling Cisco IoT to serve 67,000 businesses around the world. Cisco success is based on our market leading IoT portfolio with compliance across industries, deep knowledge of Cyber Security, and trust globally customers place in Cisco. To accelerate IoT market, we are bringing a range of new partner programs, training and design capabilities for the IoT partner eco-system.\nSuccess in IoT requires a diverse partner eco-system\nThe IoT market requires collaboration across the partner ecosystem, with each partner bringing the right technology or expertise to successfully deliver outcomes for each target industry. The breadth of partners engaged in Industrial IoT range from channel partners, system integrators, ISVs, cloud partners, to equipment builders. Customers also need integration and channel partners to help create, install and maintain these IoT solutions.\n  Cisco is known for our relationships with IT partners. We have a full range of programs to help grow their businesses. These include the Cisco IoT Authorization Program and the Cisco IoT Essentials training program that help our IT partners succeed with our IoT product portfolio.   Our IT partners like Presidio, Dimension Data and Axians are extending their practices to serve the extended enterprise \xe2\x80\x93 securely connect assets and manage the flow of data from the IoT edge to the enterprise applications.\nCisco has also been working, for many years, with the operational technology (OT) partners as well. These are the industrial ecosystem of machine builders and industrial control system vendors that integrate Cisco IoT technologies into their products or solutions and across the full range of industries like Manufacturing, Transportation, Oil & Gas, Utilities.  Industrial channel partners, like INS, a pioneer in distributing industrial networking to the operational technology (OT) buyers, have developed Cisco practices to serve Manufacturing and Oil & Gas customers\nCybersecurity requires IT and OT collaboration\nAs more and more devices, machines and assets are connected to enterprise networks, cybersecurity is top-of-mind for all customers. This is creating a net-new opportunity for our IT and integration partners to extend their practices and begin to work closely with their OT counterparts.\nAs the security and networking market leader, Cisco IoT\xe2\x80\x99s product portfolio includes a comprehensive cybersecurity offering that provides deep insights, anomaly detection and segmentation to protect industrial environments.  Our IT partners are creating practices and delivering security solutions to customers across the globe.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor our major automotive client, Cybersecurity is a key requirement for any solution on the plant floor. We have worked with Cisco IoT to create a customized solution to deliver a world-class cybersecurity solution. The Catalyst IE 3400H switch delivered an elevated level of technical capability for a world-class secure manufacturing environment allowing us to win plant refresh opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jason Dendler, Global Client Executive at NTT (formerly Dimension Data).\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecurity is the top concern for most of our customers, we have extensively used Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s broad portfolio of networking and security products in our practice,\xe2\x80\x9d says Juan Lopez, CTO for Axians France. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were working with Sentryo prior to Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition and are excited to accelerate our Cybersecurity operational technologies (OT) practice with the entire Cisco IoT portfolio. We now assist our customers\xe2\x80\x99 IT and OT departments to collaborate to protect industrial control systems across a range of industries.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Taking IoT success to the next level\nTo ensure the continued success of all our IoT partners, I am pleased to announce a suite of new programs, incentives, and training.  They are designed to empower our partners to better serve their customers.\nIntroducing Cisco IoT Design-In Program \xe2\x80\x93 a NEW partner program for integrators, machine builders, industrial control system vendors\nFor years we have been helping integrators, machine builders, and industrial control system vendors provide integrated solutions. They are connecting and digitizing their products to enable new business models and revenue streams. They have been taking Cisco off-the-shelf industrial switches, routers, access points and integrating them as a part of their larger solution. But because every use case is different, the integration process can be long and difficult.\nTo simplify the process, Cisco is introducing the Cisco IoT Design-In Program. It is the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever systematic industrial networking program. The program authorizes these partners to resell Cisco IoT products. But more importantly, it includes tools and resources that speed IoT integrations by using known commonalities to enable repeatable solutions that scale. Design-In standardizes, simplifies, and accelerates integrations and is reinforced by decades of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s experience in working with these integrations. It speeds time to market, improves profitability and increases reliability through pre-integrated and validated designs, development and integration enablement services, and Cisco product and marketing support. Learn all the details of this program here.\nNew advanced partner training for better customer support\nTo ensure customer success, we believe in making sure our customers have knowledgeable pre- and post-sales support. Last year, we introduced Partner IoT Essentials training. Since then, we have trained over 2500 partner sellers on IoT, and over 153 partner firms have been certified. In January 2020, we will launch an extension to the training program, called IoT Advantage. Partners who complete this advanced course will be able to accelerate their practices by focusing on proven use cases with ROIs to address customer needs. They will learn how our tools and technology, including industrial cybersecurity and edge compute, can help them profitably deliver these services. IoT Advantage training is available for IoT Essentials certified partner sellers and technical staff to ramp up their skills.\nImproved partner profitability to sell our portfolio\nWe are continuing to streamline ordering and access to our IoT portfolio of products. IoT IGNITE is a new program that offers additional discounts to Cisco IoT Authorized Partners and Cisco Partners, allowing them to take advantage of the most comprehensive industrial networking portfolio in the business to improve profitability.\nTo recap, IoT presents a significant opportunity for our customers to drive efficiencies, improve customer experiences and revenue through the digitization of their businesses. It also provides a huge opportunity for our partners to create new revenue streams with connected devices services and value-added support. And most importantly cybersecurity is a catalyst for IT to engage deeper with OT in the ongoing IT and OT collaboration quest.\nI look forward to talking more about the IoT product portfolio, programs, training and other resources at Cisco Partner Summit next week.

179,Helping partners integrate Cisco IoT products: Cisco IoT Design-In Program,Param Singh,"b'Now more than ever, integrators, equipment builders and industrial control system vendors are building IoT into their products and solution to offer new services and more value to their customers. Equipment as a service, data and analytics offerings, or just gaining operational efficiencies for themselves and their customers are examples of how they are using IoT. But anyone who has delivered a connected IoT-enabled solution will tell you that it is a long and painful process. Every integration use case is different. Every project starts from scratch. Historical knowledge, repeatable solutions and standard processes are non-existent. At Cisco, we believe IoT projects should be easier. So today, we are announcing the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first-ever systematic industrial networking program, called Cisco IoT Design-In.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCisco IoT Design-In Program accelerates partners time to market by helping them develop, market and sell the integration of Cisco IoT products into their solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d says Christian Renaud, Research Vice President, Internet of Things at 451 Research.\nDesign-In supports wide variety of use cases\nRegardless of whether you need a highly customized solution or just basic connectivity, Design-In can help speed the process. The Cisco IoT Design-In Program supports two types of integrations.\nProduct Design-In: Cisco Networking boards embedded into purpose-built appliances or equipment or white labeled to expand your product line\nSolution Design-In: Cisco off-the-shelf industrial products integrated into your solutions\nThese integrated solutions are used in a variety of use cases and industries. One common example is that of \xe2\x80\x98Connected machines\xe2\x80\x99. Often machines in factories or assets in remote locations (like those in oil fields or transportation) are not connected or managed. Industrial Operators and technicians have to provision and manage these machines manually and one at a time. One of the features of the Design-In program is \xe2\x80\x98Reference Guides\xe2\x80\x99 that partners can more quickly integrate Cisco IoT networking into industrial devices, enabling customers to remotely connect, manage and access data. These Design-in reference guides also provide the appropriate cyber security best practices that can be incorporated into partner solutions. For use cases that require an extreme amount of customization such as those created by Defense integrators we provide the design patterns that make the integration of our networking boards into equipment as simple and intuitive as possible.\nAccelerating Cisco IoT integrations\nCisco IoT Design-In accelerates the integration of Cisco IoT products by finding, documenting and using best practices to build and scale. It is a complete life cycle program with the right resources so partners can more quickly and accurately develop, market and sell the value of the integration of our IoT products into their offerings. It provides a standardized process with three distinct phases.\nDiscover \xe2\x80\x93 accelerates by starting with a standardized approach for every use case. We help partners find the right Cisco product and give them the tools and resources to design and plan their deployment.\nDevelop \xe2\x80\x93 reduces time figuring out the integration and increases project reliability and success. Our award-winning development program, DevNet, gives them all they need to develop and test their solution.\nDeliver \xe2\x80\x93 speeds time to market. We work with our partners to identify the commercial agreements that best fit their needs. These agreements authorize the partner with the rights to resell Cisco networking as a part of their products or solutions. We also provide industrial technical and sales enablement support, and with access to Cisco marketing resources and brand logos.\nAs part of this program, we have developed new capabilities in each phase that takes the time and pain out of the integration. These capabilities are highlighted below.\nSpeeds selection of Cisco products (Discover phase)\nNo longer will partners need to sift thru scores of web pages and data sheet to determine which product in our portfolio is the right product for their use case. Our new product selector tool has filters that automatically guide them to the right product.\nStep-by-step planning help (Discover phase)\nNew Design-In reference guides give partners all they need to scope, develop and implement their use case. These guides eliminate the piecemeal, trial and error approach through real use cases that have been tested and validated. Partners find the use case that most closely resembles their deployment, and its associated reference guide provides the step-by-step instructions for success.\nAll they need to develop and test their solution (Develop phase)\nIn the Develop phase, DevNet, our development program, has new capabilities that help integrate our products smoothly and quickly. And these new capabilities are not just for IT, but for the first time, are also tailored to OT. Based on the use cases in the Design-In reference guides, it offers new learning labs for on-demand training and sandboxes for testing \xe2\x80\x93 all in simulated environments. Finally, it offers integration validation testing allowing third-party apps to be run, tested and certified compatible on Cisco products. DevNet\xe2\x80\x99s tools and resources reduces time figuring out integration issues and increases project reliability and success.\nCisco-Powered marketing support (Deliver phase)\nThe Deliver phase gives partners the flexibility to brand as their own or use Cisco to help them go-to-market. Authorized partners can display select Cisco Logos to give customers the confidence that their product has Cisco quality, reliability and security built inside. And we offer marketing resources to help them communicate the Cisco value. This along with a new simplified commercial agreements speed time to revenue.\nFast and efficient customer support (Deliver phase)\nFinally, partners can also take advantage of our new Industrial Technical Support Service program in the Deliver phase. It allows them to create new revenue streams by branding the support as their own. Cisco provides robust training so that they can provide world-class Level 1 and 2 customer support. Level 3 support can be provided by Cisco. This ensures better customer satisfaction as these customers stay current with security patches, software updates and the support they need on our products.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccess in today\xe2\x80\x99s digital transformation efforts requires support throughout the ecosystem, including from both suppliers and solution partners. The new Design-In Program reaffirms Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to industrial control system vendor, equipment manufacturer and system integrator partners by applying its many decades of best practice learnings to a systematic program,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chantal Polsonetti, ARC Advisory Group Vice President & Industry Analyst.\nIntegrations aren\xe2\x80\x99t easy, but Cisco is helping all along the integration path with what we have learned throughout our years of integrating our industrial IoT products. The result? Our partners are shortening their lead times, improving profitability and reducing their risk. Our customers, in turn, get the IoT services they need, faster, to stay ahead.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that Nashville is a fitting venue for discussing the Cisco-Emerson partnership \xe2\x80\x93 collaboration that harmonizes the strengths of the IoT networking and cybersecurity leader with those of the leader in operations technology.\nDuring the event, it\xe2\x80\x99s been energizing to talk with plant managers and other industrial leaders about how Cisco and Emerson are turning up the volume on data collection, plant productivity, and worker safety. Many of these customers are responsible for operating oil refineries, chemical plants and other hazardous locations \xe2\x80\x93 where temperatures are extreme and volatile materials create dangerous conditions. They recognize the potential value of deploying Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s IoT sensors and other devices throughout their environments, and they know that Emerson offers products not just for remotely monitoring but also for controlling equipment and other infrastructure.\nIn these environments, Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s industrial connected services with their IoT sensors can help improve visibility to problems before they become difficult to solve. They can help identify potentially dangerous scenarios without deploying workers and putting their safety at risk. They can also eliminate manual monitoring and reporting that drive up labor costs. Across the board, these solutions enable real-time analytics for improving safety, efficiency and productivity.\nAlthough traditional networking solutions aren\xe2\x80\x99t designed to perform in these environments, Cisco and Emerson are making it possible to deploy fully wireless industrial IoT solutions in even the largest of hazardous environments. Call it the perfect \xe2\x80\x9cduet\xe2\x80\x9d: the next-generation WirelessHART gateway, the Emerson Wireless 1410S, fully integrates with Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Series Access Points, which are purpose-built to deliver the highest standards of Wi-Fi performance in environments with Class 1 Division 2 certification.\nIn short, Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s gateways collect data from thousands of sensors in the field, while Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s access points \xe2\x80\x9ctranslate\xe2\x80\x9d it for the wider network so the data can come to life in Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s Plantweb applications.\nThis combination creates a resilient wireless mesh architecture that connects Emerson\xe2\x80\x99s IoT sensors with reporting and management dashboards \xe2\x80\x93 securely and reliably. It also means that operational technology now benefits from Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s intent-based networking and security capabilities that both strengthen and simplify management.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re here in Nashville, too, be sure to stop by and see us at the Cisco booth.

182,An introduction to edge computing and use case examples,Mirko Grabel,"b'What is Edge Computing?\nEdge computing is a very loosely defined term in the industry. Many people are familiar with it, but there are differences in understanding what it means. There is common knowledge that edge computing is data that is processed at the edge of the network. This means that the data is processed before it crosses any wide area network (WAN), and therefore is NOT processed in a traditional data center, whether it be a private or public cloud data center.\nBut there are many ways to create edge computing data. For example, IoT sensors (meaning sensors that measure a machine or the environment) create data that is processed in edge compute.\nSo why do businesses need edge computing?\nEdge computing can offer different benefits to different industries. In some cases, edge computing can help with processing time sensitive data more quickly. In other cases, it can simply help businesses maintain certain government compliance regulations. It can also help save on bandwidth costs. In the three examples below, I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined specific examples of how edge computing can improve IoT processes across the transportation, utilities and manufacturing industries.\nEdge compute for transportation safety\nAs more autonomous vehicles make their way onto public roads, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to think about how their technology can help to keep the passengers inside those vehicles safe. Edge computing can help with that. Autonomous vehicles require a combination of technologies including video camera feeds. These feeds are instrumental in maintaining the overall safety of the vehicles and the passengers inside.\nBut if autonomous vehicles send their video feed data to a data center, seconds are added to the overall time it takes for that data to get processed. As drivers know, all it takes is a couple of seconds for a vehicle to get into an accident. With a central compute system inside the vehicle, data can be processed faster, decisions can be made seconds quicker and help keep passengers safe, all thanks to edge computing.\nRemote data collection for utility providers\nFor utility providers, collecting certain types of data to stay compliant with government regulations is standard procedure. Many of these utility providers are required to collect and store data for years. In remote locations, often the WAN is unreliable making it difficult to send data to the appropriate data center to maintain compliance.\nEdge computing ensures the compliance requirements are met even without WAN connectivity.  Edge computing allows the data to be collected and stored locally at the remote site without needing to be transferred back to a data center.\nEdge compute for manufacturing\nIn the manufacturing vertical we at Cisco often work with two different types of customers: the machine operators and the machine manufacturers. While the machine operators have the flexibility to process the data wherever they want, including small industrial data centers right inside the factory, the machine manufacturers often do not have these options.\nMachine manufacturers often sell machines to other manufacturers as a single device that stand inside the factory floor. In this example, the manufacturers that purchase and use these machines do not have dedicated network connectivity to these since that would require additional server equipment to be installed near those machines.\nTherefore, the machine operators must integrate any edge compute device right into the machine. That way they can leverage edge compute to pre-process and evaluate the data from all sensors directly on the machine.\nThis allows machine manufacturers to offer predictive maintenance services as well as remote monitoring & management services which ultimately increase the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).\nHow Cisco addresses edge compute in IoT\nCisco is already known as the best-in-class networking equipment provider for enterprise networks, but we go further. Unlike other solutions that require up multiple vendors to deploy an edge compute solution, Cisco provides it all in one. We integrate edge compute into our industrial networking products (routers, switches, wireless access points) to make deployments and management easier. We also offer an application infrastructure framework, called Cisco IOx, that enables apps to run at the edge on Docker and on other formats. Its simple and intuitive workflow helps developers build, run and debug their edge applications. The result? Digitization of assets in the most efficient way.\nReady to learn more?\nIf you are interested in learning more about how Cisco supports edge compute, I recommend you check out our IOx product page and our developer resources in IoT Dev Center on our DevNet page. Here we give example use cases, resources and information on how you can start a free trial of our products!\nResource\nWhat is Edge Computing?\nShare'",Tags: Cisco DevNet edge computing IIoT Internet of Things (IoT),"September 19, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1572904361-bpfull.jpg
183,Wi-Fi in hazardous locations: five must-haves,Henry Teichert,"b'In oil and gas refineries and chemical manufacturing plants, Wi-Fi makes it possible to give technicians greater access to information and systems \xe2\x80\x93 including video conferencing with remote experts to troubleshoot operations and maintenance challenges. It enables location awareness, so it\xe2\x80\x99s faster and easier to track people and assets, pinpointing where a problem may occur \xe2\x80\x93 and, in the event of an accident or other emergency, to quickly locate and assist a worker. In short, Wi-Fi is crucial to a host of IoT solutions that boosts site productivity, fuels production efficiency, and addresses compliance requirements and safety regulations.\nYet traditional access points have numerous limitations that have made it challenging for companies to realize those critical advantages in hazardous locations. Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points overcome traditional limitations with five must-have attributes:\nPurpose built. Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points are designed and built specifically for hazardous environments. A sealed, corrosion-resistant enclosure, including IP67 dust and water resistance, protects each device. These access points also have a lightweight, compact design for simpler deployments in extreme temperature ranges. The result: faster implementation and accelerated time to value.\nSingle vendor. While traditional access points can be modified for hazardous locations, those changes introduce significant cost and complexity spanning multiple vendors. Cisco Catalyst  IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points are certified for hazardous conditions right out of the box. In fact, they are the leading access points on the market with Class 1, Division 2 certification. \nSimplified security. Cisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points fit within your existing security architecture \xe2\x80\x93 making it possible to carry security policies through from the data center to the hazardous IoT edge.\nSimplified management. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Intent-Based Networking extends networking tools, processes and management to the IoT edge, facilitating a smooth partnership between information tech and operational tech resources.\nFuture proof. Multiple ports and partner-designed IoT expansion modules for WirelessHART and ISA100 among others, offer flexibility to integrate new capabilities as they become available. In addition to delivering value quickly, these access points will deliver value for the long haul.\nCisco Catalyst IW6300 Heavy Duty Access Points were unveiled in June at Cisco Live U.S., and we\xe2\x80\x99re excited to announce that they are available to order starting in October 2019. Make them the cornerstone of digitization in your hazardous environments \xe2\x80\x93 and prepare to unleash the full benefits of resilient Wi-Fi mesh.\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) Oil and Gas wifi,"September 17, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1555415377-bpfull.jpg
184,Cisco one of first networking companies to receive two IEC 62443 certifications for industrial switches,Samuel Pasquier,"b'Every sector focused on automation and control \xe2\x80\x93 from manufacturing and transportation to utilities \xe2\x80\x93 relies on the ISA99/IEC 62443 series of standards to ensure the security of critical infrastructure. At Cisco, we are proud that not only have we been serving as a contributing member in defining these standards, but we are also among the first networking companies to obtain two IEC 62443 certifications for our industrial switches.\nIn July, Cisco obtained a dual certification for the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series Switches, which provide security, robustness and flexibility at the network edge.\nThis combined certification, which includes IEC 62443-4-2 and IEC 62443-4-1, covers both product security and secure development life-cycle requirements, and uniquely positions Cisco to help our customers meet compliance requirements from procurement mandates to ongoing assurance that products can be trusted.\nProduct Security Certification: IEC 62443-4-2\nIEC 62443-4-2 covers Security for Industrial Automation and Control Systems: Technical Security Requirements for IACS Components.\nThe IEC 62443-4-2 standard delineates cybersecurity technical requirements for components that make up an industrial automation and control system \xe2\x80\x93 specifically, the embedded devices, network components, host components and software applications. For the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series Switches, those security capabilities include:\nHardware trust anchor and Secureboot\nRun time defenses\nVisibility and troubleshooting\nModern crypto\nAuthentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)\nProduct Life-Cycle Certification: IEC 62443-4-1\nIn April, Cisco obtained certification for IEC 62443-4-1, Product Security Development Life-cycle Requirements, for all IoT and Industrial IoT products in our portfolio. This reflects our longstanding commitment to a secure development lifecycle. In fact, our experience with the Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle helped in shaping this global standard.\nWith this certification, our customers have further assurance that every stage of the Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle process meets rigorous cybersecurity standards. In addition to ensuring no \xe2\x80\x9cback doors\xe2\x80\x9d for attackers to exploit, this certification underscores that we maintain a security culture \xe2\x80\x93 and that our products can be trusted to be secure even after new features are added or updates are implemented. This is especially important in an environment where Industrial IoT (IIoT) merges with existing Industrial Automation and Control Systems in a more agile environment.\nMy colleague, Maik Seewald \xe2\x80\x93 a contributing member to ISA99 and IEC 62443 standards \xe2\x80\x93 explains the value of these dual certifications: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen customers choose Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series Switches, they have not only confidence that we meet the component requirements as specified in IEC 62443-4-2, the dual certification with IEC 62443-4-1 ensures that this is not just a snapshot but a product (family) where a secure development process is an essential part of product creation and deeply rooted in  the culture of our development teams.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd these certifications are just the tip of the iceberg regarding Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to industrial security. In August, Cisco completed the acquisition of Sentryo \xe2\x80\x93 a France-based company that provides asset visibility and cybersecurity solutions for industrial control systems. Because security will always be top of mind for our customers, Cisco IoT will continue to build and deliver certified products that address their security needs.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Security Cisco IoT IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) ISA/IEC 62443 Manufacturing Transportation Utilities,"September 10, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607113527-Samuel-Pasquier-150x150.jpg
185,Reducing Germany’s carbon footprint one Cisco IoT router at a time,Sarah Roper,"b'The need for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar has been shown to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, using renewable energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels, which are major sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Germany is aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020, by 55 percent by 2030 with renewables to make up 80 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s gross power consumption by 2050.\nAnd innogy \xe2\x80\x93 an Essen, Germany-based utility provider \xe2\x80\x93 is at the forefront of that transition. The utility offers energy generated from renewable sources to both businesses and households, supporting 22 million customers across Germany, the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, and in areas of Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe.\nBut leveraging renewable energy sources isn\xe2\x80\x99t always a stable, predictable and consistent process. The supply of power fluctuates because sometimes the sun doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shine during the day. Sometimes the wind doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blow. So to help address this fluctuating supply of power, innogy needed an IoT solution to help reduce Germany\xe2\x80\x99s carbon footprint, all while maintaining a balance between energy supply and consumption.\nThe energy provider uses Cisco 807 (IR807) Industrial Integrated Services Routers at its remote utilities infrastructure as well as secondary substations. These secondary substations transform power to safe levels for residential and business customers. And because of their special role within the grid, the operational staff must follow numerous safety protocols to keep everything running.\nBut even in less traditional network environments such as secondary substations, data still needs to be collected and transferred securely so analysis can be conducted offsite.\nAt innogy, massive amounts of data are collected at secondary substations as the power is transformed. For a utility provider, transformer and power data along with data that provides the status of renewable energy sources is critical to collect. With the help of control systems, innogy can capture data at these remote sites, then transfer it to the command center for analysis.\nWith Cisco, innogy can connect weather sensors to our industrial routers to help synchronize live weather updates to its control center. This is just another example of how extending a network beyond traditional spaces can help enterprises get new insights from the data they collect.\nBetter technology for a better future\nGermany\xe2\x80\x99s utility leader shows no signs of stopping when it comes to innovating with Cisco IoT. The provider is already in early stages of testing and deploying the new Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Router Rugged to continue to build its robust network.\nSo to drive a brighter, more energy efficient future, innogy looks to Cisco IoT.

186,Cisco Ranked #1 in Market Share for Industrial Networking,Patty Medberry,"b'When people think of networking, they think of Cisco. But in the industrial networking space, sometimes that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case. In the past, organizations connecting areas such as manufacturing floors, oil rigs, traffic intersections relied on specialized vendors for their industrial IoT networking needs. Not anymore. I am proud to announce that for the second year in row, Cisco is #1 in industrial networking market share. This includes layer 2 and layer 3 switching, wireless and routing. In fact, according to IHS, Cisco is the only major vendor growing across all categories.\nNo Longer Will Any Networking Solution Do\nData from IoT projects is critical to helping organizations stay competitive.  But problems with scale, IoT security and complexity block progress. More and more, operations are bringing in IT specialists to overcome these issues and lay a solid network foundation to help ensure project success. And this is where Cisco is uniquely equipped to help.\nCisco Enterprise Networking and Security\nOther networking solutions are more complex. To connect an IoT deployment, IT often must add another domain. This creates added burden, forcing IT to manage one more network. And with the large number of devices connected, manual setup and operations isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option. Only Cisco offers an integrated multi-domain networking architecture. It extends the powerful capabilities of the enterprise network, including intent-based networking, to the IoT edge. With Cisco intent-based networking (IBN), you can automate key IT functions and provide centralized visibility and control across your entire network \xe2\x80\x93 from your campus to your branch, data center and to your IoT deployments.\nAnd because most IoT projects bring more risk, security must be part of the equation. We are uniquely positioned to deliver a fully integrated Cisco security architecture without gaps in coverage. Our multi-layered, built-in approach is across every layer of our IoT stack. Coupled with our multi-domain architecture and intent-based networking, you can enforce unified security policies throughout your enterprise.\nThese networking and security capabilities provide scale and security unlike anyone else in the market so that you can deploy with confidence.\nIndustrial Protocol Interoperability\nThe second part of the equation adds interoperability and compliance. To get data, a large number of IoT sensors and machines must connect to the Internet. But the protocols they use are not common in traditional IT networks. Our industrial networking products support a wide variety of industrial protocols such as Modbus, Profinet, CIP, and IEC 61850 GOOSE. You get interoperability and compliance with the network scale and security you need.\nThe Right Form Factor and Design\nThe third part of the equation ensures that you can scale and deploy IoT wherever you need it. Key business operations are not always in the headquarters or the branch office. The data you need can be on the front lines of your operations like in remote oil pipelines, dirty/dusty manufacturing floors, or service vehicles. None of these are conducive to rack-mounted, ambient temperature network products. To help you connect, Cisco IoT offers ruggedized and heavy-duty routers, switches and wireless access points in small and modularized form factors. We have built them to withstand extreme temperatures, dust and moisture, and vibration. They come in sizes that are small enough to deploy in cars or on light poles or wherever you need it \xe2\x80\x93 not just in a 19-inch rack. And unlike many other vendors, no extra enclosures required!\nCisco Industrial Networking: The Foundation for IoT Success\nWhen added together, these are the core networking capabilities that you need as a foundation for a successful IoT project. IT gets the network that they know and trust without added burden. Operations gets a solid network foundation that is reliable, scalable and secure and that works in their environment allowing them to capture the data the need to move the business forward.\nLearn how Cisco IoT\xe2\x80\x99s industrial networking can help your IoT deployments.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco IoT IHS IIoT Internet of Things (IoT),"September 3, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192007-pmertz-1-150x150.jpg

188,Caldas da Rainha: Old city with modern IoT vision,Sarah Roper,"b'Although the Portuguese city of Caldas da Rainha traces its history to 1484, it\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly modern when it comes to using IoT to become a smarter, more livable and more prosperous community. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s setting a compelling example that other cities can follow as they work to unlock IoT\xe2\x80\x99s potential.\nCaldas da Rainha is typical of Portuguese cities \xe2\x80\x93 that is, managed through a federation of municipal authorities and organizations, each with its own leadership, processes and infrastructure. In the past, these silos have created some challenges when it comes to IT management. For the city\xe2\x80\x99s IoT vision, leaders knew they needed to implement a single, enterprise approach that could provide network interoperability and flexibility to accommodate dynamic needs and diverse ways of working.\nThey found such an approach working with Cisco IoT and our partner, Actility.\nCaldas da Rainha has invested in a full breadth of products from the Cisco IoT portfolio \xe2\x80\x93 including industrial switches and IoT gateways \xe2\x80\x93 to provide connectivity throughout its footprint of 250 square kilometers. Building on a core of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, the city has installed Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series ruggedized switches to provide street-layer connectivity and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 1000 Series to cover remote areas. Caldas da Rainha also implemented low-power Cisco LoRaWAN\xe2\x84\xa2 Gateways to connect a growing array of IoT sensors and devices, and it counts on Cisco wireless access points to provide Wi-Fi to city residents and tourists. The city uses Cisco Prime to keep it all humming.\nAccording to Actility, Cisco and Actility\xe2\x80\x99s partnership is opening doors to a wide range of new ecosystem partners that can easily embrace technology like LoRaWAN networking because not only is it an open, standards-based framework, it makes network rollouts very much future proof. It then becomes increasingly interesting for the city to develop this long tail of applications on top of the same network.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Caldas da Rainha is doing in collaboration with Actility, which helps orchestrate the city\xe2\x80\x99s growing collection of IoT applications \xe2\x80\x93 including solutions for improving water management and monitoring parking, bus systems and waste collection. For example, the city has IoT sensors monitoring water quality and consumption. Within the first few weeks of testing, the system detected a leak of 200,000 liters \xe2\x80\x93 and then helped in controlling and correcting the problem. To date, Caldas da Rainha has reduced water management costs by 33 percent. The city has also reduced waste collection costs by 67 percent and slashed the time to find a parking spot in half.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur Cisco network is an important new chapter of our magical city and the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFernando Manuel Tinta Ferreira, Mayor, Caldas da Rainha\nThese improvements are only the beginning. With the Cisco network in place, the city can confidently adopt more IoT devices, sensors and applications that support a wide variety of smart city solutions \xe2\x80\x93 from smart streetlamps to smart buildings with artificial intelligence and much more.\nAs other cities look to migrate from proprietary to open, standards-based technologies \xe2\x80\x93 making it possible to accommodate diverse requirements and continually interoperate the latest solutions \xe2\x80\x93 Caldas da Rainha offers an inspiring example of success.\nShare'",Tags: Actility Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches LoRaWAN Smart Cities,"August 12, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1551977104-bpfull.jpg
189,Keeping the city of New Orleans safe with Cisco IoT,Sanat Kamal Bahl,"b'While the Big Easy has long been famous for letting the good times roll, New Orleans is increasingly recognized for good times AND less crime. In fact, since the 2017 launch of its Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC), the City has become a leader in using Cisco IoT solutions to support public safety.\nCore to the City\xe2\x80\x99s IoT solutions are hundreds of IP cameras installed on nearly every corner. These cameras \xe2\x80\x93 powered securely by a wireless network of ruggedized Cisco ISR with the Cisco IR829 integrated service routers (ISR) \xe2\x80\x93 stream live video to the RTCC. In a matter of minutes, the RTCC processes and shares relevant footage with officers in the field. It also gathers and analyzes video footage as part of longer-term investigations of criminal activity and quality-of-life concerns.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cisco IR829 has supported everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked it to do. It has been extremely reliable and very robust in every aspect of every solution we\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown at it.\xe2\x80\x9d \nRichard Couget, Network Manager, City of New Orleans\nImagine it: Rather than showing up at a scene with little or no background information, police arrive armed with critical insights. In the past, it might take an officer 20 minutes to interview both parties involved in a car accident. With accident footage in tow, the officer can handle the situation and return to the field far more quickly.\nIn other cases, the City\xe2\x80\x99s IP cameras catch crimes in progress. Within minutes, the RTCC sends footage to nearby walking-beat police officers who can quickly identify and arrest the culprits. And whether responding within minutes or days after a crime has occurred, having concrete evidence in hand enables greater police efficiency when interviewing witnesses and suspects.\n\xe2\x80\x9cReal-time video is like having a force multiplier\nas a virtual partner. It helps eliminate challenges\nand adds tremendous value.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGeorge Brown, IT Manager, New Orleans Real-Time Crime Center\nThe City\xe2\x80\x99s concept of the network edge also keeps evolving. As the city deploys more Cisco ISR routers using the Cisco IR829s with integrated enterprise wireless access points, the edge is becoming mobile. That\xe2\x80\x99s helping New Orleans extend its network far beyond fixed areas.\nNew Orleans police are also saving thousands of hours on radio upgrades. In the past, officers had to bring equipment into headquarters for firmware and software upgrades. With the help of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s secure Wi-Fi access point network, they can now upgrade their radios while in the field. In 2018, these remote upgrades saved the New Orleans police department nearly 2,500 public safety manpower hours. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, this \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual\xe2\x80\x9d extension between police stations and vehicles helps officers stay focused on what matters most: keeping the streets safe.\nIn short, the Big Easy is using Cisco IoT solutions to overcome big challenges \xe2\x80\x93 and achieving its lowest crime rates in decades.

The routers had be hardened for rough environments and, most importantly, offer built-in LTE connectivity.\nGreat River Energy chose Cisco IR829 industrial integrated services routers and IE 2000 and IE 3000 switches. The organization successfully deployed nearly 525 IR829 routers and up to 400 IE 2000 switches to deliver superior communications services to industrial applications in the field. With that infrastructure in place, Great River Energy was able to shut down nearly one-third of their network while crews operated solely on LTE to upgrade equipment state-wide.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe basically needed to fuel the plane while it was in the air\xe2\x80\xa6\nIn one month alone, backup LTE service gave us\nan additional 10,000 hours of availability system-wide\nwhile Radio Frequency gear was being replaced.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEric Rupp, Principal Network Engineer, Great River Energy\nWith the new infrastructure, Great River Energy benefits from always-on connectivity that\xe2\x80\x99s helping optimize service reliability for everyday business. It\xe2\x80\x99s also helping lower maintenance costs and improve operations.\nBefore the migration, any outage meant dispatching technicians 24\xc3\x977, including weekends and holidays \xe2\x80\x93 driving up labor costs. Outages could also delay scheduled construction work since recovery efforts take top priority. After the migration, substations can operate on backup LTE for a short time until repairs can be better coordinated to improve operational efficiency. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, with the Cisco products, Great River Energy\xe2\x80\x99s field crews have a consistent control console across numerous sites. They now use their own customized script to automate fast over-the-air updates.\nUtility environments are demanding as a susbstation going down could be catastrophic \xe2\x80\x93 only the most rugged, reliable and easy-to-manage equipment will do.

192,Extending an Enterprise Network? Start Here.,Srikanth Narasimhan,"b'IoT sensors, cameras and other smart devices are fueling opportunities to extend digitization into entirely new parts of a business. These investments can support business process transformation, enhanced operational efficiency and better, more personalized experiences for customers and employees.\nBut implementing IoT solutions can be daunting even to veterans of network management. That\xe2\x80\x99s because most IoT sensors and devices are deployed in \xe2\x80\x9cuncarpeted\xe2\x80\x9d areas that aren\xe2\x80\x99t typically connected to the enterprise network. Those areas can range from company parking lots to warehouses, distribution centers, seaports and airports. And they bring a unique set of challenges:\nHow can IT ensure that Ethernet switches and access points can stand up to harsh conditions like extreme temperatures or exposure to shock and vibrations?\nAs IoT devices dramatically expand the attack surface, what does it take to keep the network secure?\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to position IT to manage IoT solutions as the number of devices grows exponentially in the months and years to come?\nWith the recent launch of the Extended Enterprise Cisco Validated Design (CVD) at Cisco Live, IT teams now have a proven playbook for the design, implementation and management of five Extended Enterprise use cases \xe2\x80\x93 Parking Lots, Warehouses, Distribution Centers, Ports and Airports.\nThe Extended Enterprise CVD includes in-depth design and implementation guides for Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT Networking Portfolio \xe2\x80\x93 empowering IT teams to reduce risk and accelerate speed of implementation. Although the Extended Enterprise CVD provides step-by-step guidance on taking the enterprise network to the IoT Edge, its value goes far beyond how-to instructions. Cisco engineers have tested and validated what works, proving that systems will scale and perform as intended.\nAs companies work to take the enterprise network to the IoT Edge, the Extended Enterprise CVD empowers IT teams with three key advantages:\nSimplicity. Manage and monitor the enterprise network \xe2\x80\x93 from the office to the parking lot and beyond \xe2\x80\x93 through Cisco DNA Center. This \xe2\x80\x9csingle pane of glass\xe2\x80\x9d provides full visibility and control. It also supports automation and analytics that simplify routine maintenance, as well as troubleshooting and guided remediation.\nSecurity. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Intent-based networking doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just streamline security policy creation and application in traditional \xe2\x80\x9ccarpeted\xe2\x80\x9d areas; it also automates network security in parking lots, warehouses and other rugged environments. It makes it fast and easy to ensure that IoT devices don\xe2\x80\x99t become weak links in an organization\xe2\x80\x99s security posture.\nScalability. There\xe2\x80\x99s no end in sight when it comes to the growth and expansion of IoT devices. Businesses need a sustainable and scalable approach to deploying devices beyond an initial set of sensors or cameras. As device quantities grow to the thousands or tens of thousands, implementation must be simple enough to be completed quickly and reliably by virtually any technician.\nAs IT is called upon to take the enterprise network to the IoT Edge, call on Cisco \xe2\x80\x93 and count on the Extended Enterprise CVD.

193,A Smarter Way to Connect Communities and Roadways,Arik Elberse,"b'Communities are increasingly working to get \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d by using sensors, cameras and other IoT devices to address efficiency, transportation, safety, environmental and health challenges. Though well intentioned, many communities launch pilot projects or proofs of concept without fully considering future production scale and security requirements, or the need to co-exist with various other services. Typically, this leads to multiple independent solutions that, in turn, drive up management complexity and cost. It also increases security risks.\nTo be truly smart, communities need a unified, open-standards network infrastructure that can meet today\xe2\x80\x99s needs, interoperate and scale for tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 all while streamlining management and security along the way.\nLast week at Cisco Live, Cisco IoT announced an innovative new way to support municipalities and public authorities as they embrace IoT to help solve some of their toughest problems. Available later this summer, the Connected Communities Infrastructure Cisco Validated Design (CVD) provides a multi-service network explicitly designed and validated for Smart Cities, Communities and Roadways.\nReflecting the reality that no single technology can address all needs, the Cisco Connected Communities Infrastructure solution provides a flexible and modular architecture. It\xe2\x80\x99s built to handle multiple, diverse applications and use cases and to incorporate new capabilities as they emerge. While it can serve as the foundation for Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s market-leading Cisco Kinetic for Cities platform, this infrastructure can also support platforms and applications for Smart Cities and transportation management from other providers. The Cisco Services organization also fully supports the Connected Communities Infrastructure solution, and will support it as part of their Connected Roadways offer.\nThe Connected Communities Infrastructure CVD provides step-by-step design and implementation guidance for a multi-service network that can support a broad set of use cases, including Lighting, Safety and Security, Roadways and Urban Mobility, Waste, Parking, Environment and Water. The network technologies to support these use cases have been tested and validated by Cisco engineers \xe2\x80\x93 providing assurance that the infrastructure will support them as intended.\nTwo of the greatest strengths of Connected Communities Infrastructure are ease of management and security \xe2\x80\x93 enabled by these components of the architecture:\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Network Architecture. The Connected Communities Infrastructure is based on Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Network Architecture and uses Intent-Based Networking to dramatically lower deployment, maintenance and security costs and operational efforts. Consistent policies and security are designed in \xe2\x80\x93 with simplified, centralized management using Cisco DNA Center and Cisco Identity Services Engine. In short, it offers intuitive, automated management well suited to public organizations with ambitious missions, but constrained budgetary and human resources.\nCisco Software-Defined Access. Siloed \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d solutions bring a host of disadvantages in terms of cost and complexity. And yet, there are numerous reasons municipalities or public authorities may require defined boundaries between some programs and services. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Communities Infrastructure provides the flexibility to operate separate programs \xe2\x80\x93 while still integrating and supporting multiple solutions on a unified foundation. Cisco Software-Defined Access enables a single, physical network infrastructure that can be securely shared and segmented into multiple virtual networks. These virtual networks can then be provisioned on a per-service or per-department basis \xe2\x80\x93 each with its own policies, service characteristics and security needs.\nSolutions for Smart Cities, Communities and Roadways will continue taking shape in the months and years to come. As IoT technologies evolve and expand, Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Communities Infrastructure provides a secure, future-proof foundation to meet today\xe2\x80\x99s needs \xe2\x80\x93 and keeps pace with dynamic opportunities in the future.

196,Extending Intent-Based Networking to the IoT Edge with Cisco Catalyst Industrial Ethernet Rugged Series of Switches,Sanat Kamal Bahl,"b'The Internet of Things (IoT) is no longer simply aspirational. It\xe2\x80\x99s coming to life all around us.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing IoT in action in warehouses and distribution centers, where it\xe2\x80\x99s connecting supply chain systems to deliver real-time visibility for safer, smarter operations.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s helping utility operators find and fix problems faster, to minimize downtime of their most important systems, and reduce service outages.\nFor roadways, IoT is connecting sensors, IP cameras, and digital signage that are powering real-time monitoring of traffic and road conditions, for improved flow and safety.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing IoT in action in manufacturing, where factories are connecting sensors, robots, and other IoT edge devices to automate processes, cut downtime, and boost productivity.\nFor example, Georgia-Pacific was looking for a way to unify network management over more than 135 paper manufacturing sites, struggling with complexity and high management costs. The company wanted to provide control to both its IT and Operations Technology (OT) teams, but connections from its enterprise network to harsh outdoor environments were unreliable and unmanaged, with poor network visibility. Georgia-Pacific needed a network solution that would not only fit its factory environments but could be easily managed by its existing IT teams.\nGeorgia-Pacific plans to deploy Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series switches as a key part of its IoT ethernet switching solution, to provide a compact, hardened switching solution that can be managed on the same common platform as its office network environment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday Georgia-Pacific is a market leader in consumer and forest products and our growth is fueled by the efficiencies gained through Internet of Things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Moore, Senior Director of IT at Georgia-Pacific. \xe2\x80\x9cEarly field trials of the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series has laid the foundation for future opportunities to expand intent-based networking and with it centralized management and security to the edge of the network. We look forward to continuing to deploy Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT industrial solutions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIntent-Based Networking takes IoT to the next level\nWhy is Intent-Based Networking (IBN) such an essential requirement for IoT solutions? The tremendous variety and volume of IoT devices and connections generates vast amounts of data, but it\xe2\x80\x99s often siloed and scattered. To unleash the value of all that data, you need connectivity that\xe2\x80\x99s reliable, fast, secure, and easy to manage. That means moving IBN to the IoT edge.\nThe power of IBN lies in its ability to reduce complexity. IBN simplifies network deployment and management by automating key IT functions and providing centralized visibility and control over everything from network performance to security, analytics, and operations.\nHowever, the IoT edge has distinct challenges. Conditions are often harsh, with IoT devices exposed to the elements, extreme temperatures, and demanding manufacturing conditions.\nSecurity is essential at the edge. A breach in security could lead to an electrical grid going down, stolen intellectual property in manufacturing environments, or worker safety issues in a mine or oil rig.\nIoT environments often have demanding form factors, operating in utility boxes, roadways, and other environments that are small and difficult to connect to power cables. These remote environments can often be difficult to manage.\nYou may be running specialized applications at the edge and require networking components that support industry specifications like automation or substation environments. And as your business evolves, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a future-proof solution that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to upgrade and expand.\nCisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series Switches Deliver What It Takes\nCisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series switches are fundamental for extending IBN at the IoT edge. Built from the ground up for today\xe2\x80\x99s IoT applications, they deliver advanced, full Gigabit Ethernet connectivity in a modular, future-proof design.\nDeeply integrated, multi-layer security is baked right into the architecture from the very beginning, with intelligent CiscoTrustSec providing policy-based access control, identity-aware networking, and data confidentiality and integrity.\nAvailable in three base platforms, they come in fixed form factors as well as modular offerings, with many expansion modules to support copper, fiber, and PoE ports. They feature a tough, hardened design that can withstand freezing heat or extreme cold, and are fully tested and qualified for demanding industrial applications. To ease installation, Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series switches support Power over Ethernet (PoE) and PoE+, so you can use one cable for connectivity and power.\nPerhaps best of all, the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series is fully manageable with the same familiar, next-generation IOS-XE tools used to manage your enterprise network. They are ready for Cisco Software-Defined Access and bring Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) support for IBN to industrial Ethernet applications.\nWe can help you accelerate your digital transformation and gain the insight and agility you need to drive unlock dramatic business outcomes, just as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done for Georgia-Pacific and other companies around the world.

197,Powering Performance and Security for Today’s Demanding Applications,Henry Teichert,"b'As the IoT industry matures, it is unleashing a new era of highly sophisticated applications. Many of these innovative applications are bringing artificial intelligence (AI) into the mix, extracting, processing and analyzing large volumes of data in real-time to deliver superior insights and capabilities that were unthinkable a few years ago.\nWhat happens when you bring together Gigabit-speed performance, robust security, and a rugged design to the network infrastructure? You set the stage for new levels of intelligence and agility for increasingly advanced IoT applications.\nFor example, with access to rich high-definition video streams from cameras, AI-powered surveillance systems can now detect and recognize objects, people and animals in real-time\xe2\x80\x94and identify threats and security breaches. Sophisticated surveillance systems, enabled by a high-speed network, can stitch together live video footage from multiple cameras, and record events from different angles to develop 360-degree situational awareness of an area that is being monitored. This is a huge benefit for public safety and security personnel who depend on surveillance systems to detect and solve crimes.\nDigital billboards are another compelling application where rich high definition video streams powered by an intelligent network are key to the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s experience. Dynamic, smart billboards can stream advertisements in real-time and adjust content based on the environment and people looking at the billboard. Highly interactive experiences can be layered on top of the rich digital billboard platform to engage onlookers and present a compelling, personalized message.\nPublic safety is another arena where secure, high-performance networking shines. For example, using an infrastructure enabled by rugged, high-speed network switches, transportation agencies can support real-time monitoring of traffic via cameras and sensors, even in sub-freezing conditions and harsh outdoor environments. The solution also enables live traffic monitoring to better analyze traffic flow and can even check license plates to control traffic in reduced emission zones.\nAs manufacturing process improvements increase rates of production, quality control is becoming more challenging. Manufacturers are increasingly looking to computer vision systems in combination with big data analytics to capture high definition video from multiple cameras on the production line. Automated optical inspection lets them proactively detect cosmetic flaws, misalignments, and irregularities.\nIntelligence and agility, enabled by performance and security\nAll of these great examples of IoT in action are enabled by real-time access to rich data sets, accessed via a high-performance, high-speed network. Until recently, issues such as high costs, lack of enterprise-grade security, complex management tools, and the environmental challenges of operating an outdoor network made it difficult to widely deploy these applications.\nThe introduction of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s next generation of high speed IoT Networking products is bringing down these barriers. Cisco Catalyst IE3300/IE3400 Rugged Series Switches deliver Gigabit Ethernet speeds required for bandwidth-intensive media and real-time analytics. They bring high performance IoT applications to the mainstream by offering superior value for price, end-to-end enterprise grade security, easy to use management tools.\nCisco Catalyst IE3300/IE3400 Rugged Series Switches let you operate large and scalable networks with the management you require to reduce complexity and improve reliable operation. Their ruggedized design lets them operate in harsh environments as well as in extreme temperatures. You can deploy them outdoors or in any non-carpeted area, from Alaska to Arizona, and use them to connect your cameras and sensors to your enterprise network. Their design innovations deliver Gigabit Ethernet speeds in a compact form factor that\xe2\x80\x99s suitable for outdoor cabinets or other space-constrained environments.\nDelivering a unique combination of performance, security, and manageability, the Cisco Catalyst IE3300/IE3400 Rugged Series heralds a new beginning in the mainstream adoption of data rich IoT applications.

199,HMI 2019: Connecting the Dots,Bryan Tantzen,"b'While at Hannover Messe 2019 a couple of weeks ago, I was struck by how much the event has changed since nine years ago. Back then, the halls were dominated by components and controls. It was about five years ago that Industry 4.0 emerged, with many dismissing it as some combination of hype and pipe dream. This year, however, it was crystal clear that manufacturers and their vendors are gearing up to make Industry 4.0 real. Companies are ready and willing\xe2\x80\x94but not always able\xe2\x80\x94to capture and analyze new operational data to create new revenue streams, efficiencies, and increase profits.\nWalking the halls at HMI, it seemed nearly every exhibitor was focused on the quest for Industry 4.0. I saw countless diagrams depicting a company\xe2\x80\x99s robot or sensor with a \xe2\x80\x9cdotted line\xe2\x80\x9d to the cloud. In every case, that line symbolizes how those vast quantities of data are actually moved from the factory to the cloud. As those vendors were quick to acknowledge to their customers, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the network, and you can use whatever network you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTrouble is, I heard over and over from attendees that their organizations have executed successful tests and pilots of Industry 4.0 solutions, but then they get stuck as they attempt to take their science project and deploy it across 20 factories. In virtually every case, they are running headfirst into network security, scalability, and complexity challenges.\nTo put it more bluntly, the dot-dot-dot lines that look elegant on marketing diagrams aren\xe2\x80\x99t so simple in the real world!\nNo one knows that better than Cisco. We\xe2\x80\x99ve long been the plumbers of the Internet, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re becoming the plumbers to securely connect Industry 4.0. As my colleague, Paul Didier, explained in his well-attended session at Hannover, we understand network scalability, complexity and security challenges\xe2\x80\x94and already know how to solve for them.  This need in the market to have a future proof and secure enabling foundation for Industry 4.0 is what has propelled Cisco to #1 market share in Industrial networking this year.\nHere is what we reiterated in countless conversations at the event: For manufacturers, we serve as the bridge between IT and OT. How? By harmonizing proprietary network protocols. Tying OT networks in to enterprise IT networks for faster deployment and simpler maintenance. And we are building a foundation now to help companies embrace Time-Sensitive Networking in the near term and 5G capabilities as the technology develops.\nIt was incredibly energizing to help spread those messages at HMI. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even more exciting to go back to Germany in 2020 and celebrate the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ll achieve\xe2\x80\x94together\xe2\x80\x94over the next 12 months.\n  Additional Resources\nExecutive Blog: Liz Centoni, SVP and General Manager, Internet of Things at Cisco, The Digital Factory, Open For Business\nBlog: Samuel Pasquier, Director, Product Management, Internet of Things at Cisco, Bringing It All Together: Industry 4.0 at HMI\nBlog: Paul Didier, Solutions Architect, Internet of Things at Cisco, Three Challenges to Accelerating Industry 4.0\nRelated Industry 4.0 Blogs\nFor more information about Cisco IoT, visit www.cisco.com/go/iot\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT Cisco Manufacturing digital factory Hannover Messe HMI 2019 Industry 4.0 Internet of Things (IoT),"April 24, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/320-150x150.jpg
200,Utilities: Industrial networks need IT security,Samuel Pasquier,"b'There are plenty of historic and technological reasons why utilities\xe2\x80\x99 industrial networks have been disconnected from their enterprise IT networks. As utilities continue to plan for and invest in new infrastructure for the coming decades, they have a critical opportunity to transform their networks.\nAcross the industry, the goal is to future-proof a utility\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 both in terms of how it can adapt and scale to meet changing needs and how it can be secured against the growing array of cyber threats. Cyberattacks were not a concern when the legacy infrastructure was designed and deployed. Today, however, managing security risks is increasingly crucial as utilities become more frequent targets of cyberattacks aimed at disruption \xe2\x80\x93 or full takedown \xe2\x80\x93 of the grid.\nConsider that every device on an industrial network represents a potential point of entry and vulnerability. When a utility\xe2\x80\x99s industrial network is managed by local network operators, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t benefit from the cyber-security expertise of that utility\xe2\x80\x99s IT team. That leaves the utility \xe2\x80\x93 and its customers \xe2\x80\x93 exposed.\nThe architecture of next-generation infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 including implementing a unified, IP-based network \xe2\x80\x93 will be key to becoming more adaptable and more secure.\nGoing from 0% to 100% visibility\nTurku Energia, which provides heat and power generation for some 200,000 citizens in its region of Finland, recognized that a cyberattack could be devastating. Turku Energia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders made the strategic decision to unify the utility\xe2\x80\x99s networks \xe2\x80\x93 and worked with Cisco to make it happen.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCybersecurity is getting increasingly more important in the utility industry. Previously, we had almost zero visibility on the network controlling the power grid; it fundamentally operated as a separate component,\xe2\x80\x9d says Antti Nieminen, Group Manager, Substations and Automation at Turku Energia.\nFollowing the network transformation, Turku Energia is benefiting from industrial networking that can stand up to harsh environmental conditions, as well as network security that is driving visibility and rapid threat detection, data integrity, and role-based access from any location. It also has centralized management across IT and OT networks, which is saving the utility time and money on maintenance and staffing costs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are now safe in the knowledge we have an efficient, simple to operate, and most importantly, a secure network running our grid, power stations, and substations,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nieminen. \xe2\x80\x9cWith this network transformation, we feel Turku Energia is leading the way in the utility sector.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGet the full details on how this utility made it happen\xe2\x80\x94and how your organization can unify its IT and OT networks, too.\nClick here to learn more about Cisco IoT solutions.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco IoT cyberattacks Energy Internet of Things (IoT) Turku Energia Utilities,"April 16, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607113527-Samuel-Pasquier-150x150.jpg
201,Three Challenges to Accelerating Industry 4.0,Paul Didier,"b'My time at Hannover Messe 2019 has confirmed: Manufacturers recognize the value of investing in Industry 4.0. They see the potential of pushing the Internet to the edges of the machines in their production environments. And they\xe2\x80\x99re eager to gain access to data and data-driven insights that can help fuel productivity and trim costs.\nAt the same time, in my discussions with manufacturing leaders, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that most companies are facing these three key challenges:\nComplexity in getting connectivity to the devices. Many manufacturers are still operating small, unconnected networks and/or networks powered by proprietary technologies. Manufacturers need a way to connect all of the key vendors and protocols.\nGrowing security risks. Many plants still rely on local, Microsoft-based applications and other technologies that are hard to update. They\xe2\x80\x99re also hard to monitor\xe2\x80\x94leaving them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Whether hit by a targeted attack or a broad-brush campaign, manufacturers face the same fallout: significant loss of operational time and significant impact to revenues and profits.\nThe need for unprecedented scalability. Industry 4.0 initiatives will require a massive number of devices to be connected plus a massive amount of data to be collected and analyzed. That requires a level of IT networking and IT security expertise that plant operators simply haven\xe2\x80\x99t needed in the past. With this massive scale, automation will be key.\nThe good news is that while these networking challenges are largely new for manufacturing, they\xe2\x80\x99re problems Cisco\xe2\x80\x94the #1 provider of Industrial Networks globally\xe2\x80\x94has been solving for years.* As I highlighted in IT Technologies in the Production Environment, my talk at Hannover Messe on April 1, Cisco has combined our industrial networking solutions with an ecosystem of partners to put Industry 4.0 within reach today.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve designed these solutions to address manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 complexity, security and scalability challenges. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s solutions harmonize with multiple protocols to simplify the complexity. They\xe2\x80\x99re designed for resiliency and security. And our Intent-Based Networking makes it far easier to deploy networking solutions. Just tell us your networking and security goals; we can automatically configure the network based on those objectives.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re also at Hannover Messe, I welcome the chance to talk with you more about how we can help you advance your Industry 4.0 initiatives. Come see us at Hall 6, Stand F30.\n  * Industrial Edge Networking Components Report \xe2\x80\x93 2019, IHS Markit\n  Share'",Tags: #HM19 Cisco IoT Cisco Manufacturing digital factory Hannover Messe Internet of Things (IoT),"April 3, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192415-padidier-1-150x150.jpg
202,Bringing It All Together: Industry 4.0 at HMI,Samuel Pasquier,"b'As I look around the show floor here at Hannover Messe 2019, I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed by the variety of companies in attendance. You can find everything from industrial sensors. Cables. PLC. Software. Applications. Cloud. Vendors from every sector have come together in Hanover, Germany. And what ties it all together? The network.\nHow did we get there?\nOne of the biggest challenges the industry is facing in the race to Industry 4.0 is history. It got decades of investment in industrial protocols, decades of competition in fieldbuses, huge install base of proprietary equipment and systems across the world that operate with different protocols across both IP and non-IP devices. How can you drive innovation, flexibility and growth at a global scale in such a fragmentated environment?\nAt Cisco, this is a challenge that\xe2\x80\x99s very familiar\xe2\x80\xa6 We love networking and we love to see how our customers benefit from embracing open technologies.\nRemember when voice and data were on different networks? Cisco led a massive business transformation to converge these networks and transform communication to open, and interoperable systems with easy information exchange. Now Cisco is helping lead a similar convergence in industrial sectors, like manufacturing and utilities. To that end, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made instrumental changes to our portfolio, including introducing Cisco Validated Designs, enhancing existing products and attaining new certifications, such as the Wi-SUN interoperability certification. We\xe2\x80\x99re also the second company to be IEC 62443 Cybersecurity certified. This convergence is leading the transformation of these industries. And at the heart of it is the network.\nYou can thank the network for beer, too!\nTake for example one of our manufacturing customers \xe2\x80\x93 Festo. As a global manufacturer of process control and factory automation solutions, Festo\xe2\x80\x99s solutions are used across nearly every industry, from the precision needed for semi-conductor manufacturing through consistency for a craft beer brewer.\nFesto offers 23,000 products and delivers 29,000 orders totaling more than 70 tons of products worldwide per day. To succeed in serving so many industries, Festo must be able to quickly adapt its production floor and network. And for that, it counts on Cisco.\nKey to this flexibility? Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s building block production design and modular hardware approach. \xe2\x80\x9cFesto\xe2\x80\x99s automation systems rely on an advanced and integrated high-speed industrial architecture that is secure, reliable and provides real-time visibility \xe2\x80\x93 and to do this, we at Festo are utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s brand new Industrial IoT networking solutions for the factory,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Philipp Neidlein, IT Product Manager, Void and Data Network at Festo. \xe2\x80\x9cEarly deployments of the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series has opened the door to new opportunities to simplify management while continuing to deploy cutting edge, data intensive IoT applications.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOur team works tirelessly to make our IoT products and IoT blueprints deliver true business outcomes for our customers. As a product manager, I strive on customer feedback and it makes our days so much more meaningful when our customers recognize the products you thought through and took to market has such an impact on their business.\nIoT In Action at HMI\nFesto is just one of dozens of Cisco IoT manufacturing customers across the world. We are working with over 50,000 customers across industries to ensure the success of their digital journey and here are the ingredients \xe2\x80\x93 factory networking, industrial security, edge computing, and visibility and control.\nAt HMI we are showcasing our IoT Solutions along with our new IoT Products:\nFactory Networking\nWe can show you how a single, converged, unified plant-to-business network, tested and validated to support standard industrial Ethernet protocols \xe2\x80\x93 like Ethernet IP, Profinet and CCLink, along with industrial standards like Time-Sensitive Networking \xe2\x80\x93 can provide the critical backbone needed for Industry 4.0 transformation. What enables this interoperability is an IT-recognized Industrial Ethernet switching hardware set based on Catalyst enterprise switching technology, along with operations-friendly network and edge management tools. See how network simplification can reduce network maintenance costs, and reliable plant connectivity enables collaboration and innovation.\nIndustrial Security\nSafeguard and protect your operations with end-to-end security. Cisco is a recognized leader in cyber security, and our display at HMI 2019 steps customers through a layered approach to security, along with specific use cases for manufacturing. See how Cisco Identity Services Engine, Stealthwatch and Industrial Network Director come together to provide critical visibility and help simplify security in industrial settings. Secure remote access, micro-segmentation, identity-based security policies and whitelisting capabilities all help improve a manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s security posture to protect IP and ensure production integrity.\nEdge Computing\nDrive industrial insights from the edge to your applications. Cisco has demonstrated our strength on the network, but our industrial customers also demand help processing data at the right time and place. See how Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s combination of Edge Hardware, IOx \xe2\x80\x93 the virtualization and container infrastructure layer \xe2\x80\x93 and DevNet support tools help industrial customers extract, move and compute data from disparate sources around their plant to applications that drive more intelligent and actionable information, and make better decisions to optimize operations.\nVisibility and Control\nCustomers are seeking operational visibility into what\xe2\x80\x99s connected to the network and which devices and systems are communicating with each other. From an OT perspective, asset inventory and visibility into operational information are critical needs. Meanwhile, IT needs to know what is on the factory floor and how to limit cyber threats. Yet these two stakeholders typically can\xe2\x80\x99t see factory assets with the context necessary to address these requirements. Cisco is solving this problem through network management and security tools that provide visibility and security to factory assets. For OT users, Industrial Network Director identifies the devices on the floor. From there, use Stealthwatch to populate information in Cisco DNA Center. It\xe2\x80\x99s the network visibility and management platform for IT team members, who use it to see the topology and craft a holistic, sensor-to-cloud cyber defense posture.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re at HMI 2019, too, visit us at Hall 6, Stand F30.

203,"The Digital Factory, Open For Business",Liz Centoni,"b'One thing about Hannover Messe that is unmistakable? The huge SCALE of the event. Thousands of exhibitors. Hundreds of thousands of the world\xe2\x80\x99s smartest people in manufacturing. A massive exhibition footprint.\nScale is something that is very familiar to us in IoT. Scale sits at the intersection of possibility and reality. What starts as a great idea for an IoT manufacturing innovation often fails quickly when stress tested for scale. Because scale is more than the sheer numbers of IoT devices and connections.\nScale presumes two very key things: security and availability. Without those, any initiative will likely fail.\nKey tenets of IoT scale\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with security. Security is one of those words that means different things to different people. Ask someone in IT and they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about connecting users, devices, data, applications. Protecting the network and shortening the time to detection and remediation. Ask someone on the manufacturing floor and they\xe2\x80\x99ll see it completely differently.\nWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this past week is that security is a subset of safety \xe2\x80\x93 worker safety, plant safety, environmental safety, etc. And when I ask manufacturing what needs to be \xe2\x80\x98secured,\xe2\x80\x99 I hear over and over that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the network \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the recipes and the processes on manufacturing floor inside the PLCs. That\xe2\x80\x99s where some of the most critical intellectual property of the business sits and where the revenue is generated. That\xe2\x80\x99s what really needs to be secured.\nThe conversation goes similarly when I discuss availability. Availability in the manufacturing world means Zero Down Time. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean just the network. It means that network plus the supply chain, the entire plant floor, all of the equipment\xe2\x80\xa6 every aspect of the operations, around the clock and around the world. And what\xe2\x80\x99s key to that availability? Keeping the machines up and running and using technology like IoT to enable predictive maintenance \xe2\x80\x93 so that any disruptions can be avoided.\nIoT in action\nTo deliver IoT at scale, you have to start with a secure and reliable network.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s something that we at Cisco live and breathe every day as the #1 provider of Industrial Networks globally.* What does IoT at scale look like? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at one of our customers that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of \xe2\x80\x93 Zeiss.\nAs a world leader in the optics and optoelectronics industry, Zeiss delivers precision across everything they do. Working with Zeiss, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created a smart factory \xe2\x80\x93 where they\xe2\x80\x99re leveraging our industrial networking solutions to securely and reliably deliver the power of IoT. What\xe2\x80\x99s in a Smart Factory? Industrial switches and routers to connect the factories. System management to monitor and control the machine connections. Plus, the secure delivery of machine data to analytics applications at the edge of the network. One solution. One smart factory. Delivering value for IT and Operations alike. All designed so Zeiss can predict performance, protect uptime, and deliver that precision they have built a reputation on.\nThe digital factory, delivered\nAnother thing I learned at Hannover Messe? Sicherheit. I love the idea that one word captures the concepts of security and safety. At Cisco, we know that those two ideas are inseparable for our manufacturing customers. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering multi-layered approach where security is built into every layer of our IoT stack \xe2\x80\x93 from the networking hardware to the operating software and the edge computing apps.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re just at the beginning of this next industrial revolution. Powered by technology that delivers a reliable and secure network at scale. A digital factory where you can meet the production requirements of today while driving new business innovations. Things like changing your product line on the fly. More quickly introducing new products. Modelling on digital twins so that tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s innovation can move forward without disruption to today\xe2\x80\x99s operations.\nAt Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99re delivering the digital factory as a trusted partner for hundreds of manufacturing customers \xe2\x80\x93 and more than 50,000 customers across all industries, around the world.\nContact us directly to learn more about our digital factory.\nRead more about our solutions.\nLearn more about our Industrial IoT products and software.\n  * Industrial Edge Networking Components Report \xe2\x80\x93 2019, IHS Markit\n  Share'",Tags: #HM19 Cisco IoT digital factory Featured Hannover Messe Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing,"April 1, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Liz-Centoni_Cisco.com_-150x150.jpg

205,Cisco is leading the way for Wi-SUN interoperability,Rupak Chandra,"b'Utilities have been slow to adopt IoT networking due to long upgrade cycles and interoperability complexities across multiple applications with differing network needs. Yet, more and more, we hear our utility customers emphasize the need to simplify and support large-scale outdoor networks that handle an array of solutions from smart metering and distribution automation, to demand response and renewable energy integration.\nAt DistribuTECH, we shared how Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s continuing innovation is meeting this challenge. We showcased our full portfolio of utility industry solutions that include Cisco Resilient Mesh and our FAN routers, purpose-built to improve interoperability. And we announced that Cisco is the first to achieve Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) 1.0 interoperability certification for our IR509 Cisco Resilient Mesh industrial router.\nWhy is interoperability so critical? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look.\nThe challenge of interoperability\nTypically, utilities and smart cities have to satisfy many different networking use cases, with solutions from many different vendors, managed by different operations groups or even end customers. For example, a power utility may use smart grid, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Distribution Automation (DA) networks. Interoperability becomes even more important if they need to integrate Distributed Energy Resources (DER), which could include solutions where they don\xe2\x80\x99t have direct control, such as home solar, electric vehicle charging stations, or smart street lighting.\nFirst generation smart grid AMI and DA networks often used proprietary mesh networking technologies, partly IP-enabled and using proprietary security protocols. But that usually meant security was less scrutinized, less robust, and may have had unknown vulnerabilities. Without adequate interoperability, utilities have been forced to first choose a network infrastructure vendor, and then require all of their grid device vendors (e.g., for line sensors, meters, cap bank controllers) to integrate/certify communication modules from that network vendor.\nThe result is an extremely inefficient, time- and cost-intensive process for everyone involved. A utility typically has to wait a long time until the integration and field compliance is done for all the grid devices before they can deploy and use the network effectively. In the meantime, they can continue to run multiple networks each with different communication technologies for different applications (e.g., line sensor vs. volt-var control) and continue to deal with high maintenance cost, complexity, and fragility of their systems.\nCisco IoT solutions aim to reduce interoperability complexities with intent-based networking, and help speed implementation by bringing partners together through our IoT DevNet program.\nBuilding secure and reliable interoperability\nWhile security and reliability are top of mind for our utility customers, interoperability tends to take a back seat in conversations. Yet interoperability is key for continued growth in IoT \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we come in. Cisco is leading the pack with our IR509 router, the first with Wi-SUN FAN 1.0 interoperability certification.\nWi-SUN FAN 1.0 provides for basic interoperability of devices for network discovery, association, authentication, key exchange and rotation, encryption, RPL routing, and IPv6 address assignment. Wi-SUN compliance is gaining attention, and that has both network vendors and device vendors scrambling to get certified. With utilities enabling smart city infrastructures like street lighting, EV charging, and smart parking, a multitude of vendors and applications are converging on the same network, making wider adoption of Wi-SUN inevitable.\nMeanwhile, as Wi-SUN is evolving toward FAN 2.0 specifications, Cisco is keeping pace to be ready.

206,What does 5G look like for Industrial IoT?,Patrick Grossetete,"b'The next big thing in wireless is almost here. 5G mobile technology will soon be available, bringing the promise of compelling new uses cases and capabilities to transform industrial IoT (IIoT). But how will 5G impact networking architecture for industrial environments? Our new white paper, Demystifying 5G in Industrial IoT, takes a deep dive into what you need to know.\nWhat is 5G?\n5G is the fifth-generation mobile technology designed to support higher broadband throughput, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, and massive scale for IoT communications. Providing multiple access technologies, new core functions, and greater network management controls, 5G will enable diverse use cases and business models for companies across many industries such as manufacturing, transportation, utilities, oil & gas, public safety and more.\nExpanding network capabilities\nOne of the key benefits of 5G is \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork slicing,\xe2\x80\x9d which will allow businesses to get different levels of connectivity (from their service provider) to accommodate multiple use cases. 5G slices will be based on the three primary use case categories:\nEnhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB): eMBB provides higher bandwidth and higher speeds for everything from smart city applications and stadiums, to streaming infotainment in cars and planes, to seamless cloud services and fleet management telematics for safety and diagnostics.\nUltra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (uRLLC): uRLLC supports real-time, mission-critical communications such as autonomous driving, industrial robotics automation, and emergency disaster response and location services. The tactile response time is expected to be less than 1 millisecond.\nMassive Internet of Things (mIoT): MIoT serves billions of low-cost, long range, ultra-energy efficient connected devices across remote locations, as well as cloud applications with periodic, infrequent communication.\nOptimizing networks to the IoT edge\nTo capitalize on the opportunities of 5G, companies will need industrial IoT networking products that could evolve to the 5G connectivity spectrum to cover diverse use cases. As an example, Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s new modular IR1101 industrial router supports both cellular and low-power connectivity, extending secure, reliable enterprise networking from the factory floor to remote outdoor sites.\nCompanies will also need to tackle the challenge of scale. Managing thousands or millions of connected devices will require automation tools for zero-touch deployment, and centralized control to simplify network management. While these considerations can seem like barriers to adoption, at Cisco we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to roll out next-generation IoT networking solutions that bridge these gaps.\nMore and more, industrial enterprises are digitizing their operations to improve efficiency, lower production costs, increase safety and maximize profits. Download our Demystifying 5G in Industrial IoT white paper and get in-depth insights on 5G, from understanding the system architecture, frequency spectrum and network slicing, to industry innovations that become possible with 5G.\n  Share'",Tags: 5G Cisco IoT Featured IIoT Internet of Things (IoT) Manufacturing Smart Cities Transportation Utilities,"February 26, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192650-pgrosset-150x150.jpg
207,Cisco Webinar: Georgia-Pacific Extends Network to the IoT Edge,Sanat Kamal Bahl,"b'IoT can deliver monumental business value \xe2\x80\x93 but it also introduces new challenges in complexity, scalability, and security. How do you ensure reliable connectivity at outdoor field sites with huge temperature variations and extreme conditions? How do you manage all of these networking devices in your manufacturing plant and outdoor locations at scale? And how will you protect your connected enterprise after you massively expand the threat surface with the ever-increasing number of end-points?\nThe key is secure, scalabale and reliable connectivity across the stack with the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first integrated network architecture that extends intent-based networking (IBN) to the IoT edge. In our latest IoT webinar, we shared how IBN simplifies network management with unprecedented visibility and control over the enterprise network from carpeted spaces to rugged outdoor environments.\nJoining the webinar was our customer Georgia-Pacific, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest manufacturers of paper products. Tyler George, IT/OT Architect for Georgia-Pacific, highlighted their critical challenges, and how Cisco IoT solutions are enabling the company to streamline operations and realize value sooner.\nWith over 135 manufacturing sites, Georgia-Pacific had struggled with the complexity and costs of managing the enterprise network in the past. They needed a unified solution for network management that not only met the diverse needs of factory environments, but could easily be controlled by both IT and operations teams.\nThe company also needed to extend the network to outdoor environments that experience harsh conditions such as high temperatures and humidity. Previously, connecting to those sites located beyond traditional carpeted spaces had been unreliable and unmanaged, with no visibility into performance. They needed a powerful solution for network control in rugged environments, with a compact form factor to easily swap out old equipment in tight spaces.\nThe company has implemented enterprise-wide security solutions with connectivity for IP video surveillance cameras, employee badge readers, and other IoT devices deployed outside of the office which need additional PoE ports. Cisco IoT gives them modular flexibility to combine wired connectivity with POE+ wireless to more cost-efficiently manage network load across a range of use cases.\nView the webinar replay to hear more on the early benefits Georgia-Pacific is seeing from their field trials of our next-generation networking platforms, the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 industrial switches.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday Georgia-Pacific is a market leader in consumer and forest products and our growth is fueled by the efficiencies gained through IoT. Early field trials of the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Rugged Series has laid the foundation for future opportunities to expand intent-based networking and with it centralized management and security to the edge of the network. We look forward to continuing to deploy Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT industrial solutions.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Moore, Senior Director of IT, Georgia-Pacific\nCheck out the webinar replay to hear more from Georgia-Pacific, as well as Cisco IoT experts, Sanat Kamal Bahl, Director of Product Marketing; and Albert Mitchell, Senior Technical Marketing Engineer.

209,One Utility Network for the Modern Grid,Vikas Butaney,"b'Utilities are transforming. In working with over 200 utilities worldwide, we find that they are facing three key business imperatives \xe2\x80\x93 securely improving grid reliability and efficiency, integrating distributed energy resources (like wind and solar), and identifying new revenue opportunities.\nTake our customers Enedis, the primary energy distributor in France, who wants to improve their operational efficiency by modernizing 750K secondary substations and innogy, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s leading energy company, who wants to eliminate their CO2 footprint by completely transitioning to renewables.\nTo realize their business priorities and transform with the changing nature of the electricity business, customers like Enedis and innogy are beginning with \xe2\x80\x93 the foundation of a secure and reliable communications network.\nAnd who can best provide that than the global technology leader \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco. Over 50,000 customers deploy Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s secure communication technologies for Operational Technology (OT) use cases across a broad range of industries \xe2\x80\x93 from utilities and manufacturing to transportation and smart cities.\nWe continue to innovate for our utility customers, and I am excited to share our latest announcements \xe2\x80\x93Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s next-generation Industrial Routers and Catalyst Industrial Ethernet switches; enhancements to Cisco resilient mesh network now with Wi-SUN 1.0 support; new Cisco Validated Designs \xe2\x80\x93 blueprints for distribution and substation automation; and a developer eco-system extending Cisco platforms.\nInnovations like these are enabling our customers to build one utility network for their entire grid with unmatched flexibility, scale and security.\nMulti-layered grid security\nA modern, connected grid has a greater threat surface \xe2\x80\x93 making security a top concern for OT and IT alike. But securing the grid is not easy. It is a complex, multi-dimensional problem, ranging from physical security to cyber security.\nAt Cisco, we have a multi-layered security approach. We integrate security into all of our network layers \xe2\x80\x93 the hardware, operating system, and edge computing apps \xe2\x80\x93 eliminating security gaps. And our grid security solutions combine industry-leading cyber security with video surveillance to monitor physical security of remote locations \xe2\x80\x93 ensuring a comprehensive view.\nConnecting their grids through Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s secure network that is based on global security best practices like NERC CIP, empowers our customers to detect and contain threats in real time. \nFlexible deployment at scale\nCisco networks are built for flexibility. One of the largest utilities in the United States is optimizing the cost and performance of their distribution automation system by integrating multiple access technologies into a single operational network. Using Cisco IR800 series Integrated Services Routers (in areas with cellular coverage) and Cisco IR500 series and Cisco Resilient mesh (in areas without cellular coverage), they are building a unified network managed through a single pane of glass using Cisco IoT Field Network Director. And both our next-generation routers and switches have a flexible and modular design. In the future, as technologies like 5G get deployed, customers can replace a module and retain the rest of their investments.\nWe find that complex, large-scale utility problems cannot be solved by one vendor alone. That is why, we partnered with industry leaders to provide proven solutions and blueprints for successful deployments across six key utility use cases \xe2\x80\x93 Distribution Automation, Substation Automation, Utility WAN, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Grid Security, and Mobile Workforce.\nLast week we announced a new Developer Center (with free resources and tools) on Cisco DevNet for \xe2\x80\x93 ISVs, partners and customers. Now over 500,000 developers can build edge computing and security apps that can solve the utility challenges of today and tomorrow.\nTake Eximprod, our ISV partner who has developed a Virtual RTU that runs as an IOx app on the Cisco IR809 Integrated Services Router. With Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s free tools like the sandbox, utilities can test Eximprod\xe2\x80\x99s app before deployment or develop their own innovative capabilities.\nNow, with Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s flexible and scalable network and management platforms, customers can manage their entire grid and mobile workforce with ease.\nNew revenues beyond the grid\nOn top of their modern grid, utility customers are building new services for smart cities, like street lighting, waste management, electric vehicle charging and more.\nAs utilities and cities partner, they need a multi-purpose network that is standards-based and interoperable \xe2\x80\x93 the very basis of the Wi-SUN Alliance. As the founding member of this alliance, I am proud to say we have introduced the first product certified to the alliance\xe2\x80\x99s recently released FAN certification program \xe2\x80\x93 the IR509 Industrial Router.\nBy extending Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s trusted network to their new smart services, utilities can leverage familiar technologies to easily connect and manage their entire business \xe2\x80\x93 from the grid to the city. CIMCON Lighting is one such partner, who combines Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s resilient mesh network with their lighting management systems to deliver smart city lighting.\nAdditionally, Cisco Kinetic for Cities, a cloud-based smart city data aggregation platform, enables our customers to easily create new service offerings across six different domains including \xe2\x80\x93 street lighting, waste management and environmental monitoring.\nAs new revenue models emerge, Cisco will be with you every step of the way \xe2\x80\x93 from smart utilities to smart cities and beyond.\nFor more information on our recent innovations, please see the resources below.\nCisco IoT Announcement\nCisco IoT Switches\nCisco IoT Gateways\nCisco IoT Portfolio\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT Featured Internet of Things (IoT) Smart Cities Smart Grid Utilities,"February 6, 2019",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

213,The power of intent-based networking for the IoT edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'I talk to so many of our 50,000 Cisco IoT customers across various industries like manufacturing, energy, transportation and smart cities and what do I find? They struggle with the same three challenges in deploying IoT \xe2\x80\x94 project complexity, scale, and end-to-end security.\nTake one of our customers \xe2\x80\x94 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s leading energy company. They have an ambitious vision to eliminate the CO2 footprint of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s energy system. To accomplish this lofty goal, they need a network that can reliably and securely connect tens of thousands of renewable energy sources across an entire country.\nInitiatives like this need a new approach to deploying and managing IoT networks. One that directly addresses these key customer challenges.\nThat is why I am proud to announce new network capabilities and tools to help IT and operations alike, deliver on the promise of IoT. Today, at Cisco Live Barcelona, we unveiled:\nThe industry\xe2\x80\x99s first integrated network architecture that extends intent-based networking capabilities to the IoT edge.\nSo, what is intent-based networking (IBN)? IBN simplifies network deployment and management by automating key IT functions and providing centralized visibility and control over everything from network performance to security, analytics and operations.\nBy extending IBN to the IoT edge, customers like the German energy company can easily control and manage the network connecting their carpeted offices as well as all their solar parks and windmill farms \xe2\x80\x94 from a single dashboard.\nNext generation IoT networking product lines\nTo deliver the power of IBN, we are introducing two new next generation IoT networking product lines \xe2\x80\x94 Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 Series of Switches and Cisco IR1101 Integrated Services Routers \xe2\x80\x94 that are built for IBN, programmable, modular and edge enabled today.\nI am excited by the impact we can have on your IoT projects, large and small. \nDeployment at scale\nNow you can easily manage massive IoT deployments by using your existing IT skillset and familiar IBN management tools like Cisco DNA Center. We also built key product enhancements to help with scale. Our new Catalyst and ISR have fast boot-times with all the capabilities of IOS XE. Our new switches also offer zero-touch provisioning and higher PoE capacity in a compact form factor. When deploying and troubleshooting thousands of devices these capabilities makes a huge difference.\nAnd we did not just stop at product innovations. We are providing the right tools and services to make sure all deployments, no matter how big, are successful. I am happy to share that we have created three new Cisco Validated Designs. These are IoT deployment blueprints of complete solutions from Cisco and leading industrial companies. The blueprints come with bill of materials, configurations, security best practices and system design \xe2\x80\x94 all comprehensively tested by Cisco. These designs remove deployment risk and ensure more reliable and predictable outcomes.\nUnmatched flexibility\nFor many of you, the cost and effort of ripping and replacing IoT infrastructure can be prohibitive and cause significant downtime. Both our new product lines have a modular design, which means you can easily upgrade to new technologies, like 5G, without replacing the infrastructure. The IR1101 is one of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s first 5G-ready industrial router and IE3x00 switches offer modularity of interfaces for fiber, copper and PoE ports.\nAnd for customers with evolving needs and requirements, we are making our IoT infrastructure open and programmable. We are turning our community of over 500,000 developers into an innovation engine.

215,Integrating Warehouses and Distribution Centers into the Enterprise Network,Sanat Kamal Bahl,"b'We\xe2\x80\x99re witnessing digital transformation all around us, and it\xe2\x80\x99s driving fierce competition, new challenges, and compelling opportunities in every industry. In our last blog, we talked about some of the ways business are using the Internet of Things (IoT) to extend operations beyond traditional carpeted spaces inside the office and out to environments of all kinds.\nIn this edition, we\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on how organizations with complex enterprise supply chains are transforming their businesses. Global retailers, distributors, manufacturers, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and container operators are all driving innovation in the Extended Enterprise.\nThese innovators are exploring new strategies for Digital Transformation in industries to increase profitability, fulfill orders faster, improve safety, reduce cost and complexity, and more.\nEverything Starts with Connectivity\nTo achieve these outcomes, secure connectivity across your entire supply chain is key.\nYou may be hampered by siloed and independent enterprise operations in your warehouses and distribution facilities due to inadequate system integration, lack of real-time visibility, and inconsistent safety control. Manual and error-prone inventory and reporting processes cost time and money\xe2\x80\x94and create dissatisfied customers. To overcome these challenges and increase productivity and safety of your employees, you need to adopt digitization of your entire enterprise.\nThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy in busy and open industrial environments with massive volumes of traffic and employees constantly on the move. You need smart cameras and sensors to monitor operations and physical security to protect yourself against asset loss and theft, but also sophisticated cybersecurity to keep sensitive company and customer data from being compromised.\nBy securely connecting various warehouse systems \xe2\x80\x93 sensors, automated conveyors and sorters, safety and security systems and smart mobile devices you can monitor all warehouse systems and operations closely and gain access to data from disparate data sources. You can then analyze the data and develop insights to improve safety and operational efficiency.\nFinally, you need real-time visibility to track heavy equipment and other assets, so you can perform timely maintenance and keep resources available and working at their best.\nWhat You\xe2\x80\x99ll Need\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s required to connect and digitize warehouses? Enterprise supply chain environments are often harsh, dynamic environments that may be exposed to the weather, and require ruggedized connectivity to warehouse systems. To support employees and equipment on the move, they also require wireless connectivity everywhere. Physical security and real-time surveillance systems are key to keeping materials, people, and assets safe.\nAlso in order to keep IT operational costs low and centrally manage the entire enterprise, the warehouse network must be fully manageable using the same familiar management and policy-based orchestration tools used in the core enterprise. The network should provide secure access between warehouse devices and the enterprise, with the ability to scale and replicate to more warehouses and distribution centers as the organization evolves and grows.\nPutting the Extended Enterprise to Work\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take a closer look at how Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT solutions can help retailers scale to hundreds of connected and fully digitized warehouses and fulfillment centers.\nCisco Industrial Ethernet Switches and Cisco Outdoor and Industrial Access Points are purpose-built ruggedized solutions that can operate in environments without air-conditioning and deliver high performance Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for warehouse systems \xe2\x80\x93 sensors, cameras, sorters, conveyors, mobile phones etc. You can use the Cisco DNA Center to design, provision and manage these switches and APs.\nRetailers also require end-to-end management and smooth communication with upper layer systems such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Warehouse Control Systems (WCS), and cloud services. Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches and  Cisco Industrial Security Appliances (ISA) offer strong security mechanisms to enable secure integration and communication with these upper layer systems. Cisco Industrial Integrated Services Routers extend connectivity further to service fleet such as delivery trucks for efficient fleet management and tracking of shipments.\nCisco Extended Enterprise solutions improve tracking and management of assets and inventory, as well as machinery and shipping equipment. Robust cybersecurity and video surveillance help keep data and assets safe. Retailers also gain complete operational visibility into operations across the organization, by fully integrating their supply chain into business applications.\nNo matter what type of warehouse or distribution center environment you\xe2\x80\x99re supporting, Cisco Extended Enterprise solutions can help you extend your organization to gain real competitive advantages in today\xe2\x80\x99s IoT age.\n  Share'",Tags: #CiscoDNA Cisco DNA Cisco DNA Center Cisco Industrial Security Cisco IoT extended enterprise Industrial IoT (IIoT) Internet of Things (IoT) outdoor environments,"December 10, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/1519834292-bpfull.jpg

220,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge. But when leveraging data from highly distributed and disparate systems and sensors, this can create operational challenges and slow down critical decision making. By utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IC3000 gateway, enterprises can process data at the edge without having to send it to a cloud environment or to an on-premise data center.\nThe gateway can be combined with Cisco software including Cisco Kinetic Edge Fog Module to extract, compute, and move data from all sensors to the right applications at the right time; and Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) to enable zero-touch deployment of the compute gateways and edge applications at scale.\nProcessing data at the edge requires the utilization of security and privacy best practices, which is where Cisco IOx comes in. With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways.

This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless. Now more than ever, enterprises need the convenience and agility to compute at the edge to improve decision making and scale their IoT deployments, all while keeping data secure.\nTo learn more or to schedule a demo, please contact us at: ask-iot-edge@external.cisco.com\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT data edge computing Featured gateway Internet of Things (IoT),"June 20, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

223,Extending the Enterprise Network Beyond the Carpeted Floor Space,Hari Srinivasan,"b'Guest Blogger: Sanat Kamal Bahl, Director Product Marketing\nSanat Kamal Bahl leads product marketing for Industrial IoT products in Cisco IoT group.\n  Industrial IoT is booming all around us, and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it in action in the most unexpected places\xe2\x80\x94like parking lots and other outdoor spaces. As we\xe2\x80\x99ll see in this blog, outdoor connectivity is required in more places than you might think. Cities, airports, ports, stadiums, concert venues, and even retailers all own vast outdoor spaces that need to be integrated and managed as part of their enterprise infrastructure.\nAt first glance there may not be much happening in these environments, but a closer look reveals a hive of digital activity such as outdoor Wi-Fi, video surveillance cameras, physical access control, smart parking with occupancy sensors, meters, electric vehicle charging, digital signage, environmental sensors, outdoor lighting control, emergency services, phones, sprinkler systems, as well as safety and security systems.  All delivering rich, exciting new services and capabilities.\nThese outdoor spaces are high value assets, and IT needs to be able to manage them with the same familiar tools, and the same level of security, that are required in indoor office environments.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all part of what we call the Extended Enterprise. To make the most of it, today\xe2\x80\x99s businesses are extending operations beyond traditional carpeted spaces.\nUnlocking New Advantages with Digital Transformation   \nBusinesses understand that the IoT has changed everything. Traditional boundaries no longer exist, and customer and citizen expectations are evolving. Today\xe2\x80\x99s consumers expect nonstop connectivity, and the ability to interact and do business however, whenever, and wherever they wish.\nWhat happens when you bring the power and consistent management capabilities of enterprise networking into outdoor spaces? You set the stage for compelling customer outcomes.\nYou can support new customer experiences such as guided parking, improved safety and security, dynamic billboards in parking lots, outdoor retail services with kiosks, and services such as EV charging,  to name just a few.\nYou can also track assets in outdoor spaces to improve service fleet access and usage.\nTransport authorities can monitor and regulate traffic to reduce congestion and increase roadway infrastructure utilization.\nPorts can monitor shipping containers and facilities in real time to streamline supply chain operations.\nAirports can gain instant insight into jetway and runway facilities to make air transportation safer and more efficient.\nWith secure IoT connectivity, you can get more out of your networked assets and operate them more efficiently.\nCisco Delivers a Superior Approach to Outdoor Use Cases\nCisco offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that enable you to extend your enterprise to include IoT end-points in non-carpeted areas.\nTo expand the enterprise network to harsh environments, you need network connectivity with a rugged form factor that can operate without air conditioning and bring industrial and IoT endpoints into your IT environment\xe2\x80\x94seamlessly.

224,Cisco to Offer Wi-SUN Certified IoT Products for Secure Utility and Smart City Deployments,Vikas Butaney,"b'At Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering networking infrastructure to utilities and Smart Cities around the world.  Our customers have told us that they want secure interoperability across their devices and sensors connected over secure multi-purpose networks.\nAs a Sponsor member of the Wi-SUN Alliance \xe2\x80\x93 a global ecosystem of companies seeking to accelerate the implementation of open standards-based Field Area Networks (FAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) end device interoperability \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco has been actively working with member companies to define, test, and deliver a common open-standards based profile for this interoperability.\nIn the same way that diverse smartphones, tablets, computers and other devices can connect via Wi-Fi, the Wi-SUN FAN standards help ensure that diverse utility, smart city and industrial devices can securely connect to industry-grade smart utility and smart city networks.\nToday we are pleased to announce Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s support for the new Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) Certification Program. Cisco has already begun the process to certify the CGR1240, IR509, IR510, IR529, and the IR530 industrial routers under these new Wi-SUN standards \xe2\x80\x93 and we expect to offer our first Wi-SUN certified IoT products by the end of this year.\n  Wi-SUN = Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks.\nCheck out this video for a quick overview.\n  Based on open industry standards published by the IEEE and IETF, the Wi-SUN FAN Certification defines a secure, resilient, multi-service IEEE 802.15.4 mesh network that can support IPv6 Industrial IoT field applications at a million-node scale. The Wi-SUN FAN Certification will provide customers confidence that certified products in the program are interoperable with one another and sourced from multiple vendors.\nThis new certification program is the culmination of many years of significant work by Cisco \xe2\x80\x93 in collaboration with other like-minded vendors \xe2\x80\x93 to implement and validate a secure, multi-vendor, multi-service FAN infrastructure, giving customers a viable alternative to closed and proprietary service offerings.\nFurther details about the Wi-SUN Alliance can be found here.\nShare'",Tags: CGR1240 Cisco IoT FAN certification Internet of Things (IoT) InternetofEverything IR509 IR510 IR529 IR530 Wi-Fi Wi-Sun,"October 15, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
225,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge. But when leveraging data from highly distributed and disparate systems and sensors, this can create operational challenges and slow down critical decision making. By utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IC3000 gateway, enterprises can process data at the edge without having to send it to a cloud environment or to an on-premise data center.\nThe gateway can be combined with Cisco software including Cisco Kinetic Edge Fog Module to extract, compute, and move data from all sensors to the right applications at the right time; and Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) to enable zero-touch deployment of the compute gateways and edge applications at scale.\nProcessing data at the edge requires the utilization of security and privacy best practices, which is where Cisco IOx comes in. With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways. As seen at Cisco Live Orlando, the IC3000 helped demonstrate the following use cases:\nVehicle as a Sensor\nVehicles equipped with sensors can provide data such as their acceleration patterns and brake usage. This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless.

230,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge. But when leveraging data from highly distributed and disparate systems and sensors, this can create operational challenges and slow down critical decision making. By utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IC3000 gateway, enterprises can process data at the edge without having to send it to a cloud environment or to an on-premise data center.\nThe gateway can be combined with Cisco software including Cisco Kinetic Edge Fog Module to extract, compute, and move data from all sensors to the right applications at the right time; and Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) to enable zero-touch deployment of the compute gateways and edge applications at scale.\nProcessing data at the edge requires the utilization of security and privacy best practices, which is where Cisco IOx comes in. With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways. As seen at Cisco Live Orlando, the IC3000 helped demonstrate the following use cases:\nVehicle as a Sensor\nVehicles equipped with sensors can provide data such as their acceleration patterns and brake usage. This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless. Now more than ever, enterprises need the convenience and agility to compute at the edge to improve decision making and scale their IoT deployments, all while keeping data secure.\nTo learn more or to schedule a demo, please contact us at: ask-iot-edge@external.cisco.com\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT data edge computing Featured gateway Internet of Things (IoT),"June 20, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways. As seen at Cisco Live Orlando, the IC3000 helped demonstrate the following use cases:\nVehicle as a Sensor\nVehicles equipped with sensors can provide data such as their acceleration patterns and brake usage. This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless. Now more than ever, enterprises need the convenience and agility to compute at the edge to improve decision making and scale their IoT deployments, all while keeping data secure.\nTo learn more or to schedule a demo, please contact us at: ask-iot-edge@external.cisco.com\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT data edge computing Featured gateway Internet of Things (IoT),"June 20, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

240,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge.

244,Cisco to Offer Wi-SUN Certified IoT Products for Secure Utility and Smart City Deployments,Vikas Butaney,"b'At Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering networking infrastructure to utilities and Smart Cities around the world.  Our customers have told us that they want secure interoperability across their devices and sensors connected over secure multi-purpose networks.\nAs a Sponsor member of the Wi-SUN Alliance \xe2\x80\x93 a global ecosystem of companies seeking to accelerate the implementation of open standards-based Field Area Networks (FAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) end device interoperability \xe2\x80\x93 Cisco has been actively working with member companies to define, test, and deliver a common open-standards based profile for this interoperability.\nIn the same way that diverse smartphones, tablets, computers and other devices can connect via Wi-Fi, the Wi-SUN FAN standards help ensure that diverse utility, smart city and industrial devices can securely connect to industry-grade smart utility and smart city networks.\nToday we are pleased to announce Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s support for the new Wi-SUN Field Area Network (FAN) Certification Program. Cisco has already begun the process to certify the CGR1240, IR509, IR510, IR529, and the IR530 industrial routers under these new Wi-SUN standards \xe2\x80\x93 and we expect to offer our first Wi-SUN certified IoT products by the end of this year.\n  Wi-SUN = Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks.\nCheck out this video for a quick overview.\n  Based on open industry standards published by the IEEE and IETF, the Wi-SUN FAN Certification defines a secure, resilient, multi-service IEEE 802.15.4 mesh network that can support IPv6 Industrial IoT field applications at a million-node scale. The Wi-SUN FAN Certification will provide customers confidence that certified products in the program are interoperable with one another and sourced from multiple vendors.\nThis new certification program is the culmination of many years of significant work by Cisco \xe2\x80\x93 in collaboration with other like-minded vendors \xe2\x80\x93 to implement and validate a secure, multi-vendor, multi-service FAN infrastructure, giving customers a viable alternative to closed and proprietary service offerings.\nFurther details about the Wi-SUN Alliance can be found here.\nShare'",Tags: CGR1240 Cisco IoT FAN certification Internet of Things (IoT) InternetofEverything IR509 IR510 IR529 IR530 Wi-Fi Wi-Sun,"October 15, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
245,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge. But when leveraging data from highly distributed and disparate systems and sensors, this can create operational challenges and slow down critical decision making. By utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IC3000 gateway, enterprises can process data at the edge without having to send it to a cloud environment or to an on-premise data center.\nThe gateway can be combined with Cisco software including Cisco Kinetic Edge Fog Module to extract, compute, and move data from all sensors to the right applications at the right time; and Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) to enable zero-touch deployment of the compute gateways and edge applications at scale.\nProcessing data at the edge requires the utilization of security and privacy best practices, which is where Cisco IOx comes in. With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways. As seen at Cisco Live Orlando, the IC3000 helped demonstrate the following use cases:\nVehicle as a Sensor\nVehicles equipped with sensors can provide data such as their acceleration patterns and brake usage. This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless. Now more than ever, enterprises need the convenience and agility to compute at the edge to improve decision making and scale their IoT deployments, all while keeping data secure.\nTo learn more or to schedule a demo, please contact us at: ask-iot-edge@external.cisco.com\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT data edge computing Featured gateway Internet of Things (IoT),"June 20, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

250,Helping Enterprises Scale IoT Deployments with Secure Computing at the Edge,Vikas Butaney,"b'After an exciting week at Cisco Live in Orlando with hundreds of customer meetings we came away excited to see IT and Operational teams partnering together to move Industrial IoT deployments from Proof of Concept (PoC) to production.  Customers, channel and alliance partners want to ensure they have the right architecture to securely deploy and scale their distributed IoT deployments with compute at the edge as a top of mind concern.\nNot all of the data being captured at the edge is valuable for decision making and in most cases cannot be transported to a data center.  For example, a single oil rig may be equipped with 30,000 sensors that capture data, yet \xe2\x80\x93 on average \xe2\x80\x93 only 1 percent of that unstructured data is currently being utilized to drive business decisions today. So how do you determine which data needs to be processed at the edge, so that decisions can be made quickly, versus what can be sent to the cloud?\nIn addition to dealing with the deluge of data that is produced across industries, enterprises often face challenges with capturing data seamlessly. For many businesses, data is collected across disparate legacy systems from multiple vendors that are not interoperable, which then requires manual intervention in order to bridge those systems together. These makeshift multi-vendor solutions could then lead to a potential security breach.\nDuring Cisco Live, we unveiled a new IoT networking solution that addresses these scalability, data control, and security challenges. The new Cisco Industrial Compute Gateway IC3000 offers built-in security and manageability at scale, enabling faster decision making at the edge by processing and normalizing data from various sensors.\nEnterprises across vertical industries like transportation, manufacturing, oil & gas, smart cities, and utilities need to be able to make faster decisions at the edge. But when leveraging data from highly distributed and disparate systems and sensors, this can create operational challenges and slow down critical decision making. By utilizing Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IC3000 gateway, enterprises can process data at the edge without having to send it to a cloud environment or to an on-premise data center.\nThe gateway can be combined with Cisco software including Cisco Kinetic Edge Fog Module to extract, compute, and move data from all sensors to the right applications at the right time; and Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND) to enable zero-touch deployment of the compute gateways and edge applications at scale.\nProcessing data at the edge requires the utilization of security and privacy best practices, which is where Cisco IOx comes in. With Cisco IOx, the IC3000 delivers four pillars of security for edge computing environments:\nAccess control \xe2\x80\x93 Deployment and management of applications in an edge computing environment often requires roll-based user authentication, and IOx enables the network manager and the applications manager to separately perform their tasks.\nIntegrity \xe2\x80\x93 IOx enables additional security capabilities specific to edge computing environments including isolation of applications, application signature validation, secure delegated access and more.\nData confidentiality and privacy \xe2\x80\x93 IOx includes secure storage services [SSS] capabilities that securely store certificates, keys, and user data in a device. Users and applications can access SSS services running in the host through REST based APIs, through which an application can carve out data encryption.\nThreat detection and mitigation \xe2\x80\x93 IOx also enables distributed network traffic analysis so that operations managers can detect potential anomalies in applications\xe2\x80\x99 behaviors as well as record measurements for further analysis and capacity planning.\nThe IC3000 has additional layers of software and hardware security baked in. This includes a trusted Cisco Linux kernel with regular security updates (PSIRT) and secure boot, signed apps, and secure connectivity at the software layer.  At the hardware layer, the IC3000 features an anti-counterfeit, anti-tamper chip and hardware root of trust for secure boot and data. The in-depth software and hardware security schema of the IC3000 empowers enterprises to focus on their businesses, scale their IoT deployments while protecting their networks, device, and data.\nThe IC3000 in Action at Cisco Live\nAt Cisco Live, we had thousands of customers see the IoT demos across Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Kinetic and Industrial IoT networking portfolio including the Cisco 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000 Series Switches. For example, the new gateway can help provide new insights for data collected on connected roadways. As seen at Cisco Live Orlando, the IC3000 helped demonstrate the following use cases:\nVehicle as a Sensor\nVehicles equipped with sensors can provide data such as their acceleration patterns and brake usage. This type of roadway condition data can be incredibly valuable to transportation departments that aim to improve traffic congestion and driver safety. With the help of the IC3000, these transportation departments can extract and compute that vehicle sensor data quickly and securely at the edge then use that information to make decisions about what recommended speed limits should appear on digital road signs.\nPedestrian Tracking\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widely adopted in the future, it will be critical for these vehicles to be able to receive alerts when pedestrians are crossing the street. This action can be seen as an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and with the help of the IC3000, these types of events can be captured as data to be reviewed and analyzed. The IC3000 can then create a traveler information message (TIM), which would transmit over dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) to the autonomous vehicle. Once transmitted, the autonomous vehicle would receive an alert about the pedestrian crossing, helping to keep pedestrians safe.\nBut the opportunities are endless. Now more than ever, enterprises need the convenience and agility to compute at the edge to improve decision making and scale their IoT deployments, all while keeping data secure.\nTo learn more or to schedule a demo, please contact us at: ask-iot-edge@external.cisco.com\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco IoT data edge computing Featured gateway Internet of Things (IoT),"June 20, 2018",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg
