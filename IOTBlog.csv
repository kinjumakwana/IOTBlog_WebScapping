1,City of Fort Worth fast-tracks free Wi-Fi access in under-connected areas,Cyndi Barrera,"b'We are delighted to have Cyndi Barrera, Sales Vice President for State, Local, and Education (SLED) West at Presidio as guest blogger on our channel.\nThink about your daily patterns at home. Turn on the light switch, pour a drink of water, grab your phone. Using that phone you\xe2\x80\x99ll check the news, do some shopping, and pay a few bills online. The internet access you rely on every day is vital for telehealth, job market information and educational opportunities.\nThe transition to the internet of everything is great unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the millions of people in the US living in under-connected communities without easy access to online connectivity.\nA lack of internet access is now a considerable disadvantage. Kids who are unable to get online at home are more likely to have difficulty in school and risk getting lower grades. And most job postings and public information is found online these days, with much of it online only. During the pandemic, access to Wi-Fi was a clear lifeline. And in recent years, more and more routine processes have become fully digital.\nAn achievable solution\nThe City of Fort Worth, Texas has a trailblazing history of innovation and is in the early stages of its strategic plan to provide fiber connections to all residents. But that ground-breaking five-year commitment is still years away from completion. There are neighborhoods in the City that struggle to access affordable and reliable internet connectivity.\nThe City decided it would take action to bridge this digital divide by providing free public Wi-Fi to the most affected neighborhoods.\nOur team at Presidio partnered with Cisco to develop a plan and design a solution that could quickly respond to this critical need. Given that the city was able to leverage federal funding, we were able to put together an achievable solution to provide Wi-Fi to residents of five targeted neighborhoods, and do so in just weeks.\nTechnology to meet the challenge\nThe project design was in progress in just two weeks. Equipment was being ordered within a couple of months. The solution would include Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul radios (Cisco URWB), Cisco Industrial Ethernet 3300 Rugged Series switches, and Cisco Meraki MR86 access points, which were placed strategically across the neighborhoods on poles or outside public buildings. With this approach, the City was able to provide essential Wi-Fi coverage to the most under-connected areas during the multi-year deployment of city-wide fiber. It would cost less than half of fiber, and be ready to go much sooner.\nAs part of the project, Presidio worked out where equipment should be placed to ensure the best possible coverage, while avoiding signal interference from trees and other obstacles. The Presidio team also supported the deployment and fixed issues along the way, which was challenging at times to work around weather conditions.\nThe rewards of digital equality\nSo far, the City provides free public Wi-Fi access to 40,000 people in 10,000 households, with another 5,000 households due to come online very soon. The Cisco URWB Radios enable the Wi-Fi service for users as \xe2\x80\x98set it and forget it.\xe2\x80\x99 And with Cisco Umbrella security filtering content, even the youngest residents in the area will find safe internet browsing.\nCisco Cloud management solutions help provide easy network management and any interruptions, such as service outages, are flagged immediately. This kind of simplicity is a real advantage for the City. And when the fiber roll-out is complete, the technology will continue to ensure that Fort Worth has a future-ready environment for years to come.\nLearn more\nRead Written Case Study\nCisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul\nCisco Industrial Ethernet 3300 Rugged Series Switches\nCisco Umbrella Web Content Filtering\n<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_end"">\xef\xbb\xbf</span>\nCyndi Barrera has over 20 years of experience in digital, data and technology-based roles.

2,"Secure Equipment Access: more uptime, fewer truck rolls, remote access control",Angela Murphy,"b'It was a pleasure to connect with so many customers and partners at Cisco Live EMEA in Amsterdam last month. We were excited to announce several innovations \xe2\x80\x93 including new services in cloud-based Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. These innovations are game changing for industrial organizations seeking to accelerate their digital transformation, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer experiences. Our announcements included:\nEnhanced Secure Equipment Access (SEA) service increases flexibility for the remote management and maintenance of industrial assets.\nNew Cisco Cyber Vision service provides visibility into the security posture of industrial networks.\nNew industrial wireless service supports our industrial wireless series devices when operating in Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul.\nIn this blog we will discuss how organizations can maintain remote connected assets at scale with Secure Equipment Access in IoT Operations Dashboard.\nMany industrial organizations need to manage equipment in very diverse locations in order to gain the full benefits of digitization. This is top of mind for our customers and partners. Their operations are spread across entire regions and different countries. And the equipment they\xe2\x80\x99re deploying likely comes from a variety of manufacturers and may have been installed at different times. Industrial equipment \xe2\x80\x93 from roadside cameras and LiDAR cameras to signaling systems and more \xe2\x80\x93 frequently requires specialized technical support from their respective manufacturers for upgrades and troubleshooting.\nAs the number of assets grows complexity increases. Onsite network and equipment maintenance often require significant resources: the time it takes to travel to site and identify which assets need an upgrade plus the costs of getting to those sites. More time and expense are required to secure the specialized resources who can handle the upgrade or resolve an outage.\nProviding connectivity to industrial assets in remote locations is the first step for digitizing industrial environments. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s IoT portfolio provides the support required to connect industrial assets using fixed, wireless, and cellular access. And IoT Operations Dashboard, a cloud-based platform of OT services, enables the deployment and management of Cisco industrial routers and now industrial wireless backhaul.\nHowever, as more assets are connected, customers need control over how internal and external workers are accessing these assets. Many of our discussions with customers are about the need for more control over their remote access capabilities. In many cases vendors may be using different methods of access, without customer oversight or control. For more on why this matters, check out this blog on the Oldsmar Cyber Attack.\nWith the newly enhanced SEA service in IoT Operations Dashboard, it now becomes possible to securely handle configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting activities for assets connected to industrial routers remotely. In other words, what used to incur significant expense and time can now be completed without a site visit, and with visibility and control! Customers love the fact that SEA can provide centralized remote access for their vendors \xe2\x80\x93 under their own control! And with enterprise grade security controls, for example Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign On (SSO) including Active Directory (AD) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n  How it works\nSEA provides a single service that enterprise IT network managers can use to enable their operational technology (OT) experts to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot assets on the industrial network easily and securely.\nOT workers can set parameters to define which internal and external teams can access which assets, when and for what purpose:\nWhen a device on an offshore wind farm stops working, it becomes possible to diagnose \xe2\x80\x93 and even fix \xe2\x80\x93 the issue remotely.\nWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s an upgrade that affects connected cameras across a massive bus fleet, the camera manufacturer can implement the upgrade remotely \xe2\x80\x93 without technicians physically boarding every vehicle.\nWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to configure equipment at the roadside or at roadway intersections, those configurations can be set up and orchestrated remotely. The same is true of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 even when charging stations span multiple locations across a wide geographic area.\nThese activities can be carried out using just a web browser or a user application on the workstation through a direct connection to the industrial asset. Configuration files can be downloaded, and log files collected, easily. Customers are seeing the benefits: They save thousands of dollars per site in truck rolls and can easily control and oversee the access to connected industrial assets.\nIn short, SEA in Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard simplifies remote operations for anyone who manages equipment at the roadside or roadway intersections, on solar or wind farms, at EV charging infrastructure or across mass transit systems, for example. It dramatically simplifies and streamlines secure maintenance of connected assets while offering the flexibility, security, and scalability of a cloud-based platform.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking a closer look at this service in our upcoming webinar, \xe2\x80\x98How do you enable operations team to centrally manage remote access to industrial assets securely and at scale?\xe2\x80\x99 on March 23. Register today \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the first step to faster, simpler industrial IoT asset maintenance.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Secure Equipment Access Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Fleet Connected Roadways Industrial IoT (IIoT) Transportation,"March 9, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520194112-angemurp-1-150x150.png
3,Connecting industrial devices anywhere with Cisco’s new modules for LoRaWAN and 450MHz LTE,Emily Kasman,"b'Extending connectivity to remote sites can be challenging, especially when connectivity requirements differ depending on location and use case. As organizations are automating and establishing remote operations, Cisco is expanding the capabilities of the Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router to meet the connectivity requirements of businesses wherever they operate.\nAt Mobile World Congress in February of 2023, we announced two pluggable interface modules (PIM) for the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers: one for long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) connectivity and one for 450MHz private LTE connectivity.\nA modular router to meet your connectivity needs\nWireless networking technologies are constantly evolving. The Cisco Catalyst IR1101 is a modular router that supports a variety of backhaul technologies to meet your exact needs: Ethernet and xDSL as well as many different 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G radio bands and categories. Pluggable modules can be easily swapped to adapt to changes and avoid costly rip-and-replace upgrades, especially as 2G and 3G services are being sunset. The Cisco Catalyst IR1101 can be expanded to host a second wireless cellular module and more Ethernet and serial ports, as well as general purpose input/output (GPIO) and data storage to handle the most advanced use cases.\nLong-range, low-power connectivity with the Cisco PIM for LoRaWAN\nCustomers have asked us to connect their battery-powered LoRaWAN sensors to their networks\xe2\x80\x94and we are delivering with the new LoRaWAN module. The module enables the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Router to be a LoRaWAN gateway\xe2\x80\x94delivering LoRaWAN connectivity to industrial IoT sensors that typically require low bandwidth, operate on battery, and can be deployed in difficult-to-reach locations.\nUnlike many other LoRaWAN connectivity solutions, the new module in the Catalyst IR1101 can fit in space-constrained and distributed industrial environments, giving customers the flexibility and scale to install in the locations that are best for them.\nFurthermore, using the Catalyst IR1101 with two modules allows for an integrated LoRaWAN gateway with 4G/5G backhaul capabilities in a single router that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to deploy in tight spaces.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoRaWAN plays a key role in the wireless ecosystem. It\xe2\x80\x99s important for organizations that are considering using wireless technologies in their operations to evaluate all multi-RAN standards, whether LoRaWAN, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, etc., to address each use case with the right single- or multi-technology solution. Cisco is enabling just that by bringing LoRaWAN capabilities to its industrial router, enhancing an already flexible, scalable, and secure solution to meet a variety of wireless needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDonna Moore, CEO LoRa Alliance\n  Provide connectivity to your critical infrastructure with the PIM for 450MHz LTE\nThe 450MHz LTE module allows the Catalyst IR1101 to provide connectivity for mission-critical government use cases, including critical infrastructure and public safety. Connect devices such as industrial control systems and physical security equipment over a private LTE network using the 450MHz band. Public protection and disaster recovery (PPDR) regulations in Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Africa allow critical industries to reserve the 450MHz band in their areas to deploy private LTE networks, replacing legacy public safety voice networks with technology capable of data transmission. The 450MHz band provides high resiliency and deep indoor signal penetration to connect the Catalyst IR1101 anywhere onsite.\nEasily manage your infrastructure with IoT Operations Dashboard\nEasily connect, maintain, and manage network devices and industrial assets with Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard. The cloud-based IoT services platform enables easy deployment of the Catalyst IR1101 at scale, supporting wired or wireless backhaul connectivity. IoT Operations Dashboard is designed for industrial use cases: Its Secure Equipment Access service enables operations teams to easily manage connected assets remotely to minimize site visits and maximize uptime. Its Cyber Vision service provides deep visibility into assets, so that you can better manage resources, limit exposure to cyberthreats, and drive cybersecurity best practices.\nA valuable investment for today\xe2\x80\x99s industrial applications\nCisco offers a comprehensive industrial IoT portfolio to help customers meet their unique connectivity requirements. It combines modular routers supporting a wide range of private and public cellular and other wireless technologies; a cloud platform designed to easily deploy, secure, and manage distributed industrial networks; secure remote access capabilities to remotely configure and maintain assets; and more.

4,OT/IoT Security: 3 Key Takeaways from Gartner Peer Insight’s Survey,Fabien Maisl,"b'In the event of a cyberattack, are industrial organizations prepared to defend their operational technology (OT) and industrial control system (ICS) environments? Cisco set out to answer this question in a survey conducted together with Gartner Peer Insights and Takepoint Research in Q3CY22. The audience for the survey involved IT, OT, engineering, and InfoSec professionals across the globe.\nResults showed that 77 percent of industrial organizations are still in the beginning stages of their OT security journeys. And none of the participants have fully secured their OT/ICS environments yet. This fact is worrying, considering the post-pandemic world in which we find ourselves.\nMuch has changed over the last three years. The pandemic has significantly accelerated the digital transformation of OT, which has led to most\xe2\x80\x94if not all\xe2\x80\x94of organizations\xe2\x80\x99 critical operations to be integrated with digital technologies. In turn, cyberattacks such as those suffered by Colonial Pipeline, Oldsmar Water, and JBS in 2021 have become more prevalent as bad actors focus on the vulnerabilities of OT/ICS networks.\nOur conversations with C-suite executives reveal that most organizations recognize that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for a cyberattack and that many are just starting to prioritize OT security. Our survey reveals that the main goal for 58 percent of respondents is to gain comprehensive visibility on OT devices and industrial networks.\nHowever, a stunning 74 percent say that the main obstacle to securing OT at scale is the cost and complexity of building an out-of-band Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) network or deploying the network TAPs required to gain such visibility. But there is an alternative way to collect this data and build comprehensive visibility into the industrial network.\nCisco Cyber Vision embeds visibility features into network equipment, eliminating the need for sourcing, deploying, and managing dedicated security appliances or investing in costly out-of-band collection networks. This architecture provides unmatched visibility as passive discovery is achieved at every layer of the industrial network and active discovery requests are not blocked by NAT or firewall boundaries.\nOur survey highlights other interesting facts, such as the critical need to implement secure remote access solutions into the industrial network and the need to control shadow IT practices in industrial networks now that operations teams are using more cloud and industrial IoT solutions. For more insights, see the survey results in this infographic.\nFor a deeper analysis of these survey findings, download our survey report that covers all the questions we asked our panel of professionals. The report also explains how to avoid some of the obstacles that OT security specialists face during deployment.\nTo learn more about how you can secure your IoT/OT infrastructure, visit our IoT Security page or contact us.\nTo get the latest industry news on IoT Security delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe to the Cisco IoT Security Newsletter.\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Report Manufacturing Utilities,"February 23, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
5,Cisco IoT enables the global acceleration of offshore wind energy,Marcus Smith,"b'Renewable energy is a hot topic right now. Most countries globally are investing in renewable energy generation to accelerate the move toward carbon neutrality. The following technologies are not only growing steadily, but they are also mainstream now:\nOnshore and offshore wind\nOnshore solar farms\nOnshore battery storage\nOther renewable technologies are also being researched and developed (e.g. wave, tidal, other storage technologies), and we will start to see more innovative renewable energy deployments in the foreseeable future.\nSome countries are leading the push on integrating renewable energy into the grid. China and the UK are examples of countries leading the way with large deployments of wind capacity (both onshore and offshore). Europe in general is setting big targets for offshore wind and the US is also predicted to become a major offshore wind energy producer in the coming decade. Cisco can help with all these renewable energy technologies but for the purpose of this discussion, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the complexities offshore wind farms are facing and the solutions Cisco offers.\nDeploying and operating these renewable technologies can be challenging: they need to operate in harsh and remote locations, a secure and reliable network is required, and that network needs to work flawlessly with the various OT and IT technologies that form the solution.\nThis is where Cisco IoT solutions provide the foundation for the network.\nOffshore wind farms are large infrastructure deployments with multiple locations. They require:\nOnshore substation\nOffshore substation (platform offshore)\nOffshore wind turbines (ranging from 50 to 300 turbines)\nOnshore operations and maintenance offices\nOffshore Service Operations Vessels (worker accommodation, offices, and workshops while offshore)\nCisco has developed a complete Validated Design for these offshore wind farm projects. It provides customers with a blueprint solution for all phases of a project (from specification and procurement to deployment).\nThe solution includes networking infrastructure from the offshore wind turbine itself through the offshore platforms to the onshore WAN interface point and connectivity to the wind farm operators control center.\nThe Cisco CVD is modular to allow for varying wind farm sizes (i.e. design can flex to cope with increased number of turbines), provides resilient architectures to allow for fault conditions, and includes cyber security built in from the start.\nOffshore wind farms are very challenging to deploy, and automation is a key component during the deployment phase. Cisco DNA Center provides a single platform to allow zero touch deployment of infrastructure (switch and routers) at Day 0 and the ongoing management of the network.\nAdditional use cases include Service Operations Vessel (SOV) connectivity using Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul to provide high bandwidth connectivity while the SOV is offshore in the windfarm.\nThe Cisco Offshore Wind CVD provides the following benefits:\nPre-validated design and configurations\nProduct choices and validated firmware versions\nAutomation through plug and play capabilities in Cisco products\nCentralized security policies including segregation of services\nModular designs to flex for bigger projects\nValidated resilient topologies\nPlatform architecture to support existing and future devices\nValidated QOS and security configurations\nIn summary, the offshore wind farm solution provides a proven and validated blueprint for connecting devices and production assets, improving industrial security, and improving data access and operating reliability. Following this best practice blueprint with Cisco market-leading technologies will help decrease deployment time, decrease risk, decrease complexity, and improve overall security and operating uptime. The Cisco Validated Design will be available end of March. To learn more now, check out the Solution Brief for Renewable Energy\xe2\x80\x94 Offshore Wind.\nGot question?

6,MWC Barcelona: What connections will you make in 2023?,Patrick Grossetete,"b'As Mobile World Congress Barcelona fast approaches, we anticipate a productive and energizing event. More specifically, we look forward to great discussions on monetizing 5G networks. That includes opportunities for telecommunications service providers to use Cisco solutions to better support their industrial customers.\nMany industrial operations consist of numerous systems highly distributed over a site, region, or country. Think of renewable energy production such as solar and wind farms, electric-vehicle charging stations, power substations, roadways equipment, and pipelines. In most cases, wireless cellular networks are probably the most convenient way to provide the wide coverage needed to connect these operational technology (OT) assets.\nEnhancing reliable and secure connectivity at the industrial edge is key to automating industrial processes even further, driving efficiency and improving both environmental sustainability and customer satisfaction. Yet within many industrial organizations, operations teams are stretched thin. Few have the depth and breadth of expertise needed to manage large numbers of endpoint devices across a highly distributed network.\nTelecommunications service providers can help to build and maintain secure industrial networks at scale by offering Cisco 4G/5G industrial routers, such as the Catalyst IR1101 Rugged Router with automated device provisioning and cellular broadband services. They are a winning solution for service providers in simplifying deployment and growing their footprints with industrial customers.\nAt Cisco Live Europe in Amsterdam earlier this month, we unveiled several innovations to further simplify IT for managing and securing industrial networks at scale. At Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, we\xe2\x80\x99ll build on the Cisco Live announcement and add new wireless innovations to the Cisco Industrial Networking portfolio. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a preview of what we will be showcasing:\nCatalyst IR1101 and IR1800 Rugged Series Routers: These compact and highly modular rugged industrial routers are designed for connecting fixed or mobile assets.

7,Industrial IoT takes center stage at Cisco Live EMEA,Fabien Maisl,"b'Cisco Live EMEA wrapped up last week. And while the event is over, the momentum continues to build.\nConversations in Amsterdam affirmed that industrial organizations have set their sights on increasing productivity and sustainability. They want to revolutionize how they connect, manage, and secure their operations \xe2\x80\x93 and they realize that technology is essential to that goal.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re investing in building networks in new places: roadways and bridges, wind and solar farms, utility grids and manufacturing lines. These sites are often remote with harsh environmental conditions. And industrial locations can number in the hundreds, thousands or even tens of thousands \xe2\x80\x93 and be spread across regions or entire countries.\nNow consider what it takes to manage a traditional IT network: deploying and configuring hardware and software. Monitoring network infrastructure and connected devices. Keeping it all up, running, and secure. Given the realities of industrial networks, those are daunting requirements even for IT networking veterans. For most industrial operations teams, however, they represent entirely new \xe2\x80\x93 and highly complex \xe2\x80\x93 responsibilities. They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for help as they strive to realize the full potential of digitization.\nTechnologies are driving sustainability\nDuring the opening keynote, Vincenzo Ranieri, CEO of ENEL Distribution, explained how this world leading energy distribution company moved to a cloud operating model to connect and manage millions of renewable electricity production resources and reshape the power distribution value chain. Cisco has been a key partner in the past decade to help ENEL reinvent their network infrastructure, converge IT and OT to actively manage resources and enable a resilient smart grid at the scale required for such a massive transformation to a more sustainable energy production model.\nDuring the industrial IoT iTalk keynote, Chris McGookin, Lead Cyber and Telecoms Engineer at ScottishPower Renewables, explained the complexity of the industrial environment he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for. Operating windfarms in the middle of the ocean is probably one of the most challenging networking tasks. It requires a variety of fixed and wireless network technologies, connecting critical remote systems, and involving teams that need to be able to integrate these seamlessly so they can focus on the job at hand. Cisco is providing ScottishPower Renewables a comprehensive, hardened, and secure technology stack to enable simple deployment of complex industrial networks that can be remotely managed and easily duplicated to new sites.\nSimplifying IT for OT\nAt Cisco Live EMEA, our conversations focused on offering users a wide choice of networking technologies to enable their specific industrial use cases, and making deployment, management, operations, and security simple so anyone could be all in.

8,New innovations to simplify IT for industrial networks,Vikas Butaney,"b'Customers across the globe and across industries are extending their enterprise network to new places \xe2\x80\x93 whether that\xe2\x80\x99s roadways and intersections, utility grids, manufacturing lines, or even remote operations for wind farms. They are also prioritizing sustainability across their operations. But, to digitize these environments and build a greener future, they must overcome challenges, from complex connectivity needs and managing highly distributed assets through security and talent shortages.\nSolving these challenges takes a new approach. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at Cisco is that a strong partnership between all technology teams \xe2\x80\x93 whether security, networking or operations \xe2\x80\x93 is essential. Organizations need a unified, cloud-delivered approach that brings the power of the enterprise IT network to scale and secure the industrial edge. Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing new innovations leveraging the cloud to accelerate operational efficiency between these teams, reduce downtime, and enhance overall safety and security.\n  Accelerating IT and OT success through cloud-driven automation and security convergence\nCisco IoT Operations Dashboard provides cloud-delivered OT services for industrial networks. Today we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing two new cloud-based innovations in this IoT Operations Dashboard to help ensure secure operations and deliver remote access to operational devices.\nDeep visibility of connected industrial assets and your security posture: Cisco Cyber Vision is now integrated as a service in IoT Operations Dashboard. Cyber Vision delivers deep visibility into connected assets on the industrial network so that IT and OT teams can implement cybersecurity best practices. Cyber Vision automatically builds a detailed asset inventory and identifies vulnerabilities. It leverages risk scores from Cisco Kenna to then prioritize vulnerabilities for the OT teams to action. It also shares your OT asset inventory with SecureX, Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s XDR platform. Security analysts now have a full inventory of both IT and OT assets to make threat investigations easier and build remediation workflows to secure the industrial environment.\nSecure equipment access to industrial assets from anywhere: Secure Equipment Access Plus is now available in IoT Operations Dashboard. Now operations teams can remotely deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot all types of assets connected to Cisco industrial routers \xe2\x80\x93 from equipment in roadside cabinets to controllers in hard-to-reach wind turbines. This not only helps customers increase their asset uptime, but it also reduces the need for time consuming and expensive truck rolls.\n  Expanding network connectivity choices for industrial use cases\nAs the network extends further into operational areas, we continue to expand our industrial networking portfolio to ensure customer success for a wide variety of deployment scenarios and locations.\nSecure and faster connectivity for space-constrained use cases. Our new Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series switches are small, DIN-rail mounted, fully managed, all gigabit ethernet switches to connect robots, controllers, and more in harsh industrial, outdoor, and tight spaces, like in a cabinet. These switches run the IOS-XE operating software with built-in trust and security, are managed by Cisco DNA Center.\nConnect to more devices wirelessly. Even on the move. Our new Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Wireless Client is purpose-built to reliably connect mobile industrial assets, such as autonomous robots (AMRs) and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). It gives users flexibility as it can operate with standard Wi-Fi deployments or in a Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (Cisco URWB) infrastructure to deliver ultra-reliable connectivity with zero packet loss and seamless handoffs.\nFiberless wireless backhaul. The new Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point provides wireless backhaul with built-in antennas that\xe2\x80\x99s easy to deploy when fiber or cellular is not an option. External antennas can be added to support fixed and mobile use cases simultaneously.\nA digitalized, resilient and reliable power system is a precondition for reaching the ambitious goals set by European Green Deal and to finally achieve a net-zero emissions society. Cisco is a key partner in our digitalization journey and its advanced industrial networking capabilities have enabled us to optimize, secure and digitalize our energy distribution networks at scale \xe2\x80\x93 all through a mutual understanding of the respective challenges and a common willingness to contribute for the successful transition of our energy system.\n\xe2\x80\x93Vincenzo Ranieri, CEO, e-distribuzione\nAs Siemens Gamesa is deploying a growing number of wind turbines across the world, we need innovative technologies to accelerate adoption of renewable and sustainable energy. We\xe2\x80\x99re partnering with Cisco to build networking solutions for our turbines so we can automate deployments, support harsh environmental conditions, handle complex power-grid specificities, and even deliver mobile wireless connectivity where cellular is not an option. Cisco solutions are helping us converge IT and OT, better handle complex operational constraints, and address ever increasing regulatory and cybersecurity requirements.\n\xe2\x80\x93Jan Holmberg Jakobsen, Team Lead for OT Network Development, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy A/S\nNetwork Rail own, repair, and develop Britain\xe2\x80\x99s railway infrastructure. It\xe2\x80\x99s our role to run a safe, reliable, and efficient railway to get people and goods where they need to be. Operational data and analytics are becoming increasingly important for us in driving efficiencies and improving our services. Platforms such as the new IE3100 will allow us to securely deploy sensor and analytics services at the trackside to help us reach key goals.\n\xe2\x80\x93Brian Hatfield, Director of Telecom Services, Network Rail\nCollectively these innovations accelerate a strong partnership between IT and OT teams \xe2\x80\x93 helping organizations simplify IT for distributed networks, securely connect their IoT operations at scale, and experience significant gains in productivity and efficiency.\n  Learn more\nRegister for our customer Webinar: New innovations to simplify IT for industrial networks\nAdditional resources\nIoT Operations Dashboard\nCyber Vision & IoT Operations Dashboard At-A-Glance\nCatalyst IE3100 Rugged Series\nCatalyst IW9165E Rugged Series\nCatalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Series\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE3100 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Catalyst IW9165E Rugged Access Point and Wireless Client Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Network Automation Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard Cisco Live EMEA Utilities Wireless Backhaul Cisco Catalyst IW9165D Heavy Duty Access Point,"February 7, 2023",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520193643-vbutaney-150x150.jpg

10,Securing industrial networks can – and should – be simple,Andrew McPhee,"b'Implementing security inside the industrial network can be a daunting task. Security directives such as CISA\xe2\x80\x99s Shields Up have caused more industrial organizations to assess their network posture and seek guidance to improve the protections of critical resources for business continuity. Upon seeking this guidance, many are left confused with terms such as Zero Trust and Microsegmentation, resulting in more questions and no route to action.\nSecurity can, and should, be simple. Whether you follow guidance from ISA/IEC 62443\xe2\x80\x94the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\xe2\x80\x94or have implemented the Purdue model, the core security principle is to divide the network into multiple zones and create policy for the communication that crosses zone boundaries.\nDefining secured zones\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s take the ISA/IEC 62443 definition of zones and conduits. A zone, according to the standard, is a collection of physically and functionally united assets that have similar security requirements. In a manufacturing facility, this could be a single production line. A conduit is described as the communication between zones. The conduit is the communication channel in which security policy should be applied.\nDefining the zones and knowing which policy to assign to the conduits is what makes security perceived as difficult. However, segmentation should not be viewed as a single standalone task. Effective segmentation is comprised of two key pillars: visibility and control.\nICS visibility informs OT segmentation\nVisibility into industrial control system (ICS) operations gives us an inventory of all assets that exist on the network, along with their communication patterns. This enables us to visualize the processes in our networks and answer the question: what are the zones on my network? Using Cisco Cyber Vision, an ICS visibility tool that is embedded into the network infrastructure, operators can identify assets that belong to a process and assign them to a group for easier visualization. Rather than focusing attention on every flow, from every asset, communication can be visualized in the conduits between the zones, providing a blueprint of the policy that must be defined.\nAs for the enforcement of these traffic patterns, that too can be embedded into the network infrastructure using a technology called TrustSec. Cisco TrustSec provides you with an easier way to manage access control policies across switches using a security group matrix.\nAs traffic enters and leaves their network segment, rather than enforcing traffic using IP information, Cisco TrustSec uses a Security Group Tag (SGT) embedded in the MAC layer of the network traffic to determine policy. Using Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) SGTs can be assigned to your zones and the matrix can be used to control the communication across the conduits.\nUsing the built-in integrations, Cyber Vision shares its grouping information with Cisco ISE so operations managers can create and manage assets groups in their OT visibility tool, so IT can easily create the proper control rules between those zones in ISE.\nIn a recent webinar, I went into more details, diving into the ISA/IEC 62443 zones and conduits model and showing how to use Cisco ISE and Cyber Vision to enforce OT Microsegmentation. You can watch the replay by registering here.\nUntil then, have a look at our ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 white paper and make sure you subscribe to our Industrial Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Security Cisco ISE Cisco TrustSec Critical Infrastructure Featured ISA/IEC 62443 Network Segmentation,"December 13, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/IL20220725202503-anmcphee-150x150.jpeg
11,SDWAN for utility operational use? Are you sure?,Marcus Smith,"b'Enterprises have widely deployed Software Defined WAN (SDWAN) over the past 10 years. The solution delivers assurance for applications, both in the cloud and in the data center, especially for remote users. The migration of many enterprise applications to the cloud during the pandemic has further driven the use of SDWAN. But does it offer any real benefits for utilities? Can it help utilities with deploying WAN connectivity to substations and distributed renewable energy sites? The answer is definitely Yes! And SDWAN can even provide benefits to simplify and streamline the provisioning of WAN infrastructure to these remote operational sites.\nMost utilities today are used to building large networks utilizing technologies such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN) to encrypt critical Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) communications, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for the underlying transport network, and public or private cellular for remote sites with no other WAN connectivity. SDWAN brings these technologies together and enables automation to greatly simplify deployments.\nAutomation benefits\nZero Touch deployment of field gateways (i.e., no field staff required to configure a gateway)\nSimple provisioning of service VPNs to segregate traffic (SCADA, CCTV, PMU, IP Telephony etc)\nTemplated configurations making it easy to change configuration and push it to gateways.\nApplication of unified security policies across a diverse range of remote sites and equipment\nManaging multiple backhaul connectivity options at the gateway including private MPLS for critical SCADA traffic and cellular for backup and even internet-based connections for non-critical traffic, where appropriate.\nLifecycle management of gateways (e.g., firmware updates, alarm monitoring and statistics)\nDeploying an SDWAN Overlay also allows the utility to control the end-to-end IP addressing schemes and remove the need to engineer complex routing plans based on the underlying transport network, quite often provided by a 3rd party service provider. This divorces the underlying transport network from the overlay network. Hence, it simplifies operational tasks and provides less reliance on the underlying network providers to make changes, which often have a cost associated for the utility such as adding a new service VPN for a new service is as simple as adding it to your gateway templates and deploying it.\nExamples of SDWAN technologies deployed by utilities\nSubstation gateway \xe2\x80\x93 larger substation gateways providing resilient WAN connectivity and security functionality (Zone based Firewall)\nDistribution Automation \xe2\x80\x93 secondary substations, pole mounted equipment or other field assets such as reclosers or capacitor banks.\nRenewable energy sites \xe2\x80\x93 connecting onshore wind turbines, solar plants, and battery storage sites.\nDistributed renewable energy sites\nUtilities are now having to connect an array of renewable energy assets, spread across wide geographic areas. Onshore wind, solar and battery storage elements are examples of assets that need to be connected to the utility for monitoring and/or control.\nMany renewable asset operators are also using public and private cloud-based applications, including SCADA. SDWAN can add further benefits in assuring application performance and reliability to the cloud.\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be beneficial to have a single solution with a choice of industrial gateways for different site types? We think so and Cisco provides several industrial routers to suit all deployment sites and can be managed as part of the Cisco SDWAN solution.\nCisco IoT products such as the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Series Routers for larger substations, Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers for distribution sites, and Cisco Catalyst IR8140 Heavy Duty Series Routers for outdoor field sites can all operate as SDWAN edge gateways alongside with the well-known Cisco Enterprise routers (Virtual and physical), which can be used for control centres and other operational sites to provide a single overlay network connecting to any site.\nSo, in summary, the Cisco SDWAN solution coupled with Cisco IoT Catalyst Industrial Routers is very relevant to Utility operational networks and can offer many benefits. Without compromising security, the solution is easy to use and allows to automate tasks that utilities needed to handle manually before. For Utilities already using the Cisco SDWAN solution for IT related use cases, it is easy to add Industrial endpoints to extend services to the substations. For customers using Cisco Industrial Routers today, SDWAN can be a powerful addition to the provision and management of the WAN.\nLearn more\nCisco SDWAN Solution\nCisco Substation Automation Validated Designs\nCisco IoT Catalyst Industrial Routers\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco SDWAN Cisco Validated Designs Distribution Automation Substation Automation Utilities,"December 1, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/01/IL20220124192807-Marcus-Smith-150x150.jpg
12,Connected Trackside: Delivering resilience and security,Wei Zou,"b'  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  I recently shared some key trends and challenges rail operators are navigating, as well as Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s approach to strengthening and securing onboard network infrastructure in this blog series. For this post, let\xe2\x80\x99s explore the building blocks of modern trackside networks.\nAs rail operators invest in Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC), they need trackside network infrastructure that supports ultra-reliable train-to-wayside wireless connectivity, resilience and high availability, and robust cybersecurity.\nCisco has designed an architecture that supports CBTC, vital signaling, level crossing, and other safety-critical applications. And because the same trackside infrastructure supports asset monitoring, video surveillance, passenger Wi-Fi, and other non-vital systems, the Cisco solution curbs the time and costs associated with implementation, operations, and maintenance. This unified infrastructure offers advantages that rail operators\xe2\x80\x99 aging \xe2\x80\x93 and often siloed \xe2\x80\x93 networks simply can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver.\nSignaling resilience\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s solution uses a tiered architecture composed of an access layer with ruggedized IP switching infrastructure, a highly redundant and reliable service provider or large enterprise\xe2\x80\x93grade backbone networks, and a data center connectivity layer. Together, these elements offer resilient communications paths \xe2\x80\x93 at scale \xe2\x80\x93 between trains, tracksides, stations, and operations control centers.\nSolution highlights include Cisco ruggedized Catalyst Industrial Ethernet switches at the access and distribution layer. The resilient ring topology connects trackside and station equipment, such as wayside radio, axle counter, interlocking, and other CBTC equipment. At the aggregation and backbone layer, the Cisco solution helps achieve sub-50-millisecond fast reconvergence. It achieves that by migrating from legacy circuit-based transport infrastructure to Unified Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) backhaul with fast reroute protection, by simplifying existing MPLS infrastructure with Segment Routing (SR), or by deploying a Cisco Connected Communities Infrastructure (CCI) multiservice architecture.\nSecuring trackside\nAs with all industrial organizations, rail operators are concerned about cyber security. Many have experienced a security incident; most have expressed concern about the adequacy of their current security practices.\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s industrial security journey provides a step-by-step path toward information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) convergence. It starts with building a security foundation by defining the IT/OT security boundary with Cisco secure firewall. From there, apply Cisco Cyber Vision to gain asset visibility, communication patterns, device security posture, and operational insight. Then use visibility to drive industrial network segmentation and integrate with Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) for security policy automation. Lastly, investigate threats and orchestrate response with SecureX.\nAutonomous operating systems could reduce rail traffic fatalities by up to 90%. In addition to saving lives, such a reduction would avoid US$900 billion annually in associated public health costs.[1] Resilient, secure trackside network infrastructure is a key to realizing those compelling outcomes \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s exciting to be part of that solution.\nTo learn more about the solution, please check out Cisco Connected Rail Solution Brief.\n  [1] McKinsey, \xe2\x80\x9cSignals for Growth\xe2\x80\x94how OEMs can be successful in a digitalized infrastructure\xe2\x80\x9d\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Rail: Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Transportation Wireless Backhaul,"November 17, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607133038-Wei-Zou-150x150.jpeg
13,Three ways to extend your existing IT practice into new buying centers,Vikas Butaney,"b'This morning I sat down with my coffee to read the headlines on my iPhone. And it really struck me how aligned our IoT business is to what I was reading. Energy changes around the world are impacting the macro-level global economy. Legislation and initiatives towards sustainability are reducing our carbon footprint. Cybersecurity is protecting our businesses and institutions. Technology is the common thread through all these initiatives and IoT delivers the common foundation of robust and secure connectivity.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why Cisco and our trusted network of partners are in a unique position to shine. As partners look to increase their relevance to their customer\xe2\x80\x99s business, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to look far. Partners can quickly and easily leverage existing Networking and Security practices and investments in training and certifications to get to new buyers in new places with untapped budgets like:\nBusinesses connecting their operations to lower energy usage and increase physical security with cameras and environmental sensors\nManufacturers using industrial IoT to improve plant floor efficiency and uptime\nUtilities securely weaving renewables into the grid\nCities and roadways becoming safer with smart highways and transportation\nAcross the globe, countries investing billions in critical infrastructure projects\nAs IT customers extend their network into their operational areas like these, there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge opportunity to take Cisco IoT with them. How can partners get started? Let me take you on a short journey through three IT partner stories where you see how they took their IT practice to new areas.\nTake Cisco DNA Center to new places with the existing teams\nMany of our IT partners have built practices around Cisco DNA Center and the robust automation capabilities to deploy campus networks and our Catalyst product family. That same Cisco DNA Center being used to manage the Catalyst products can also manage the Catalyst Industrial Ethernet product lines. The same software, same trainings, same licensing model, and same software sales model motion can now also serve outdoor parking lots, distribution centers, and more. That means our partners don\xe2\x80\x99t need to retrain and reorganize to get to these new budgets.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s start with a partner that\xe2\x80\x99s extending their enterprise practice into non-carpeted spaces \xe2\x80\x93 like manufacturing floors. Atea is a leading technology service provider focused on Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Nordic and Baltic regions with over 40 years\xe2\x80\x99 experience in the IT space. As more manufacturers look to modernize their operations, Atea is seeing firsthand the value of extending their existing IT practice into these new places.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to take what was traditional enterprise solutions like Cisco DNA Center into operational areas like manufacturing for net new bookings in completely new buying centers. All without having to retrain our teams or hire new talent,\xe2\x80\x9d noted Casper Ginderskov, Business Development Manager, Atea. \xe2\x80\x9cOur practice with Cisco IoT has been part of the double-digit growth that we have had over the last 2 years. Best of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been helping our customers across manufacturing \xe2\x80\x93 pharma, automotive, consumer product goods \xe2\x80\x93 transform their own businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Grow business and profits with software and cloud management\nMany of our IT partners are looking to deliver more software solutions, as well as manage and deploy via the cloud. Recurring services are a great way to build a stickier practice with customers and widen their range of services. Leveraging Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, our partners can deploy and manage a distributed set of assets that can be located anywhere for retail stores, roadways and intersections, and more. They can then add value-added services like Secure Equipment Access and IOx edge application management.\nAnother great story is New Frontier Technologies and their work with Energybox. New Frontier Technologies, a Cisco IT partner, has decades of experience merging field level automation with corporate level networking \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cwhere operations meets IT.\xe2\x80\x9d Given the increased corporate focus on sustainability and energy usage, they saw the opportunity to extend their networking products and experience into new areas. Using the capabilities of IoT Operations Dashboard to manage a set of industrial routers, they are now able to deploy in convenience stores, fast food restaurants, and gas stations and manage remotely. Plus, they are using Secure Equipment Access to remotely maintain their connected equipment and are building new software capabilities using IOx \xe2\x80\x93 our virtualization layer to deliver innovative services.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of our IT customers has an initiative underway to better manage their energy consumption. And that means they need to be able to monitor systems like refrigeration and HVAC,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike Walden, Director \xe2\x80\x93 SCADA & IT, New Frontier Technologies. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to take our IT networking expertise into these operational areas for new sales in quick service restaurants (QSR) and gas stations, as well as new recurring revenue streams with value-added monitoring services.\xe2\x80\x9d\n  Extend expertise into roadways and intersections\nI\xe2\x80\x99m guessing that we all will drive somewhere today or take some form of transportation. As we pass intersections with traffic cabinets and signals, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think about the industrial switch and industrial router that connects to the traffic controller to manage those traffic lights. But this use case is an amazing opportunity for Cisco partners to build capabilities around roadways and traffic intersections for managing congestion, pedestrian safety, traffic control, and roadway safety. This is an excellent way to extend IT practices and services to the public sector customers across state and local governments, and Department of Transportations \xe2\x80\x93 and tap into government infrastructure funds. All these services are built on a foundation of secure reliable networking.\nCDW is a leading provider of IT solutions to business, government, education and healthcare customers in the US, the UK, and Canada.

14,Connected Train: Simplifying the onboard network,Wei Zou,"b'  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\nIn the first blog in this blog series I shared that passenger volumes for urban railways, automated people movers (APMs), and other forms of mass transit continue to grow. To satisfy increasing demand while meeting safety, passenger experience, and operational efficiency goals, rail operators are ramping up investments in innovative technology solutions.\nOne of the most important is Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC). In the simplest of terms, CBTC puts passenger rail on \xe2\x80\x9cauto-pilot.\xe2\x80\x9d This high level of automation offers significant benefits for rail operators and their passengers. But CBTC also introduces new networking challenges, including the need for a simpler yet more powerful network on board each train car.\nWith the move to CBTC, rail operators are taking a fresh look at their onboard train network, implementing a multiservice foundation that shifts from disjointed proprietary networks to a common IP network.\nAt Cisco, we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a network architecture that both strengthens and simplifies the onboard train network. As part of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Connected Train solution, we provide a resilient infrastructure capable of supporting numerous services and use cases. Whether supporting vital applications such as CBTC, or non-vital applications such as passenger WiFi, CCTV, infotainment, digital signage and point-of-sale systems, the Cisco Connected Train onboard network provides the needed bandwidth, reliability, and security.\nA linchpin of our architecture is the Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series. This next-generation, IP67-rated switching platform is designed to provide enhanced network-based security, segmentation, and visibility in the most demanding environments. It can stand up to the harsh conditions rail operators often face such as heavy vibration, extreme weather, exposure to water and dust. Additionally, it is compliant with the stringent onboard rail industry standards.\nIn addition to physical durability, cyber security is another area of strength for the IE3400 Heavy Duty Series switches. Because they are powered by Cisco IOS XE, a next-generation operating system, security, and trust are built in via Secure Boot, image signing, and the Cisco Trust Anchor module.\nThe Cisco Catalyst IW9167 Series access point is another key player in our onboard network architecture. This access point provides reliable wireless connectivity for mission-critical applications on board rail cars. It can operate as Wi-Fi 6 or Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul \xe2\x80\x93 offering flexibility and mobility to accommodate evolving needs.\nWhen running in Wi-Fi mode, it provides Wi-Fi connectivity to rail personnel and passengers within the train. When connectivity provided from Cisco IW9167E (CURWB) or Cisco FM4500 wireless radio, it delivers fiber-like train-to-ground communication for both vital and nonvital applications. In either mode, it delivers the high level of bandwidth that modern rail systems \xe2\x80\x93 and their Wi-Fi-dependent passengers \xe2\x80\x93 require.\nA simple and reliable onboard network is critical to the success of CBTC systems. Another important component is resilient and secured trackside infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93 a topic I\xe2\x80\x99ll dive into in my next post.\nIn the meantime, learn more about Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities for railways, check out Cisco Connected Rail solution design zone.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series Cisco Catalyst IW9167E Heavy Duty Access Points Cisco Connected Rail Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Connected Rail: Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) Wireless Backhaul,"October 27, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/IL20220607133038-Wei-Zou-150x150.jpeg
15,Leveraging ISA/IEC 62443 to secure industrial operations is easier than you think,Fabien Maisl,"b'To many people, the ISA99/IEC 62443 industrial security standard is like a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution: You know it will bring you great benefits, so you start working on it, but you eventually give up because it looks complex or other priorities arise. But it really should not be like that. Let me explain why.\nIndustrial networks and critical infrastructures have become the new playground for cyber criminals. Whether you run global manufacturing operations, a local water utility, a power grid network or just a small industrial plant in the middle of nowhere, you are eligible for a cyber attack. What would be the result? Production halts, loss of revenue, broken industrial equipment, damage to the environment, or even injured employees. Nothing else should be higher on your priority list than securing your industrial operations.\nThe International Society of Automation (ISA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have developed the ISA99/IEC 62443 series of standards. It is a framework to implement industrial cybersecurity best practices step by step and drive continuous improvement. The series covers many aspects, but the key part is ISA/IEC 62443-3-3, which describes the security capabilities you should implement.\nSecurity requirements for all industry verticals\nSome might think that ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 is only suited for manufacturing operations, but most of its security requirements apply to all industry verticals. Furthermore, the ISA and IEC are now working on developing profiles for specific industries, so whatever you implement today will be leveraged tomorrow to comply with a more thorough list of requirements.\nTo drive you through the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3, my colleagues Andrew McPhee and Maik Seewald have written a short and detailed white paper listing all security requirements and how to comply. The main key takeaway is that by leveraging Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive industrial networking and cybersecurity portfolio, implementing the standard couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be easier.\nAs an example, the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 highlights the imperative of controlling access to resources and restricting communications by enforcing the least privilege principle that grants users and devices only the rights they need to perform their tasks. In a nutshell, asset identification, user authentication, and micro-segmentation are a must to reduce the exposure of the industrial control system (ICS) to cyberthreats and limit the spread of attacks.\nUsing Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) together with Cisco Cyber Vision, Secure Firewall, and Duo, industrial organizations can easily implement this zero-trust approach to their OT networks. These products have been designed and tested together to enable seamless workflows and out-of-the-box integration. I told you it did not have to be complex!\nThree webinars to deep dive into ISA/IEC 62443\nAndrew and Maik presented a webinar explaining the ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 and its security requirements. Learn about capabilities you might be missing today and how you can easily implement them.\nSee how to implement micro-segmentation in industrial networks. Dive into the ISA/IEC 62443 zones and conduits model and how Cisco ISE and Cyber Vision can enforce OT micro-segmentation.\nSecuring industrial operations also means leveraging IT security tools and processes. Learn how to extend IT security to industrial operations so security analysts can investigate and remediate threats across both IT and OT domains.\nWatch the webinars on demand here.\nUntil then, have a look at our ISA/IEC 62443-3-3 white paper and make sure you subscribe to our Industrial Security Newsletter.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Duo Security Cisco Industrial Security Cisco ISE Cisco Secure Firewall Cisco Zero Trust Critical Infrastructure ISA/IEC 62443 Manufacturing Utilities,"October 26, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/IL20220520192129-fabm-150x150.jpg
16,Secure the ‘last foot’ in distribution automation,Pete Kavanagh,"b'Have you ever noticed the small metal boxes attached to utility poles? If you\xe2\x80\x99re like most people, you probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid much attention to these cabinets. For Cisco and our partner, SEL, those utility cabinets presented an opportunity for innovation.\nInside each metal box are two devices: a recloser control, which mitigates the dangers of unusually high electric currents, and a router, which uses cellular service and a virtual private network (VPN) to link the recloser control to the utilities\xe2\x80\x99 wide-area network (WAN). The VPN protects grid communications between the boxes and the control center.\nBut there is still a vulnerability within each box. Cisco and SEL have joined forces to secure what is quite literally the \xe2\x80\x9clast foot\xe2\x80\x9d in distribution automation.\nCisco and SEL\xe2\x80\x99s solution for the \xe2\x80\x98last foot\xe2\x80\x99 problem\nThough hardened for physical security, utility boxes are not impossible to breach. Breaking into one yields access to the recloser control, the router, and the network cable \xe2\x80\x93 usually about one foot \xe2\x80\x93 that connects the two pieces of hardware.\nCurrently, these devices communicate with clear text, so important communications can be read by anyone with the technical know-how to intercept them. In other words, this \xe2\x80\x9clast foot\xe2\x80\x9d represents a potential vulnerability as an entry point to damage or assume control of the recloser. That could lead to undesirable consequences \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from nuisance maintenance tasks to power grid disruption.\nTogether, Cisco and SEL have created the first solution for encrypting the network traffic that travels the short but critical distance between an SEL-651R/RA recloser controls and a Cisco Catalyst IR1101 Rugged Router.\nWe built this solution using IEEE 802.1AE Media Access Control Security (MACsec) and the MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) portion of 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control. We chose MACsec because it is a mature, proven, and open standard. It\xe2\x80\x99s also stable, having undergone few updates since its publication in 2006 yet it still delivers strong encryption today.\nApplying this standard on Cisco and SEL hardware, it becomes possible to secure recloser communications without investing in external devices. The solution will be available at the end of 2022, enabling utilities to begin upgrading their distribution automation environment.\nCoordinating activities across functional groups within the utility can be extremely difficult. With that in mind, we designed the solution to be implemented in two phases. The first phase involves a truck roll to physically update each location as required. The second phase involves updating the configuration and can be handled remotely and without any disruption of service to the grid.\nGoing the extra mile for the \xe2\x80\x98last foot\xe2\x80\x99\nAs security threats and risks to utilities continue to increase, this standards-based solution from Cisco and SEL represents a vitally important tool for hardening critical infrastructure. We invite you to dive deeper into the solution by reading Securing the \xe2\x80\x98Last Foot\xe2\x80\x99 in Distribution Automation, a white paper Cisco and SEL published during DistribuTECH.\nTo explore how this solution can help you, contact us.\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers Cisco Industrial Routers Critical Infrastructure Distribution Automation Utilities,"October 25, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/07/IL20220711165719-pkavanag-150x150.jpeg
17,Four must-haves in the New Digital Substation,Paul Didier,"b'Throughout electrical substations change continues to surge.\nFor decades, utilities routed power from centralized sources. Now they are orchestrating power generation across diverse and distributed sources, including renewables like wind and solar. Substations also are navigating more complex demands as we electrify transportation such as EV\xe2\x80\x93with a growing segment of customers consuming and producing electricity.\nWhat will it take to evolve substations to address operational, customer service, cost efficiency, and environmental goals?\nThe answer is continued investment in substation automation and digitization to create an intelligent and secure electrical delivery system that relies on communications and information technology. Cisco calls this the New Digital Substation. Unlike traditional operations, the New Digital Substation handles more sustainable, distributed, and variable energy supplies as well as fluctuating demand all in real time.\nBuilding on more than a decade of experience supporting substation automation, Cisco recently published the Substation Automation 3.0 Design Guide. This Cisco Validated Design (CVD) builds on previous solutions supporting SCADA operational systems \xe2\x80\x93 and it stands out for four new and differentiated capabilities. In the quest for greater flexibility, efficiency, and security, these have become must-haves in the New Digital Substation.\nMust-have #1: Resilient, Digital Operations\nThe industry is moving to connect more equipment using standard, open communications that are designed to digitally operate substation equipment. These applications require much more from the network than the typical SCADA based applications: low-latency, highly resilient and synchronization services.\nWe designed the Cisco Catalyst IE3x00 and IE9300 Rugged Series Switches and the Cisco Catalyst IR1100 and IR8340 Rugged Series Routers to support substation automation applications based on IEC 61850 \xe2\x80\x93 the international standard that defines communication protocols for intelligent electronic devices within substations. These devices also support other substation communication protocols and can integrate with a host of legacy hardware.\nMust-have #2: Big bandwidth, small footprint\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s latest substation architecture features upgraded routing and switching solutions. The IR8340 hardware and IE9300 switches provide greater bandwidth along with more features in smaller physical footprints. As such, they can support a higher quantity of connected devices and applications while addressing goals for operational efficiency and operational cost containment.\nThe IR8340 is a router, switch, firewall, and precise timing module. The stackable IE9300 supports high-density fiber ports to resiliently connect lots of substation equipment while providing visibility of the substation devices and communication. Both also act as cyber security agents for the substation and have edge compute capability.\nMust-have #3: Simplified network management\nHistorically, grid operations teams have not needed IT or network management skills as they rely on \xe2\x80\x9cone and done\xe2\x80\x9d deployments. As operations become increasingly digital, utilities need to manage and monitor the networks to maintain uptime.\nThe Substation Automation 3.0 architecture reduces the need for network expertise. It incorporates Cisco DNA Center and Cisco Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) technologies \xe2\x80\x93 which centralizes, simplifies, and automates network deployment and management. Using these tools, a smaller team can manage devices with zero-touch configuration and maintenance.\nMust-have #4: Cyber security; visibility, protection and compliance\nAs part of any community\xe2\x80\x99s critical infrastructure, substations must be hardened against cyber-security threats. Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s Substation Automation 3.0 architecture upgrades cyber security capabilities including Cisco Cyber Vision to provide greater visibility and protection across the full ecosystem of connected devices.\nThis visibility and protection make it possible to flag suspicious communications and protect the equipment before they compromise grid security. Enhanced security and management also help address growing requirements for cyber certification (e.g. NERC/CIP), including the need to prove that essential operational processes and procedures are in place.\nThe new energy ecosystem is rapidly taking shape and electrical substations must keep pace. Consider how the Substation Automation 3.0 Design can help.\nAs with every Cisco Validated Design, we have assembled and tested all the components of the architecture. We have validated that they address resilience and interoperability goals and we have tested their ability to support core use cases, including integrating with key vendor devices and applications.\nLearn more\nGet an introduction to the new Digital Substation in our Substation Automation Solution Brief.

18,Vision Zero guaranteed?,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\n  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  In this third blog of the series, I will explore Vision Zero, aspects of safety, the need for situational awareness, and technology applications that can improve safety.\nSafety is always a top priority in roadway operations. Both the intersections, the places where roads meet, and the stretches of road between intersections must be safe and also perceived to be safe. There is an emerging focus in Europe and the USA on what could be referred to as \xe2\x80\x98Vision Zero\xe2\x80\x99. This describes a future scenario where road infrastructure is combined with advanced information technologies to deliver the value and benefits of roads with zero fatalities or crashes.\nWhat if I told you that I have found a way to achieve Vision Zero, guaranteed, overnight? I would be able to reduce the crashes on any road to zero. How would I do this? Quite simple, close the road. Radical and impractical as we can\xe2\x80\x99t close the road, so let\xe2\x80\x99s look at why we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. While safety is always paramount, the objective is not achieved in isolation but within a balanced framework of other objectives that must also be considered. We cannot place an extreme focus on one objective to the exclusion of others. There are many other objectives that smart mobility must address, at a high-level these include efficiency, enhanced user experience, and climate change management. These are the reasons why you just can\xe2\x80\x99t close a road.\nFortunately, we are starting to understand that defining safety as a primary objective not only enables us to improve the safety situation, but also helps us to address the other objectives simultaneously, as illustrated in the figure below.\n  For example, the application of advanced technology to increase trip time reliability, smooth traffic by avoiding harsh acceleration and deceleration and form vehicles into orderly platoons, can improve safety and reduce congestion. This also addresses enhancing user experience as the driver benefits from a better experience with less stops and delays.\nSo, let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss further how Vision Zero can be achieved through the application of advanced technologies and how to move towards the goal of Vision Zero in a practical and effective way.\nThe main ingredients\nSo, what are the main ingredients of a successful approach to safety? In my opinion, they are, as shown in the figure, starting at the top of the pyramid:\nThe ability to act appropriately\nBased on a high level of situational awareness, the best responses and action plans can be developed and applied. Of course, services and applications come into play again as significant implementation tools.\nAn appropriate level of situational awareness\nFrom a safety perspective it is important to know what is happening, what will happen in the future, and what to do about it. This should encompass all aspects of safety as described above.\nServices and applications that enable you to know and act\nServices and applications deliver value to the end user including travelers and fleet operators by providing information on the best choices.\nAn efficient and effective telecommunications foundation\nSituational awareness, services, and applications can only work efficiently if they are underpinned by a firm foundation in telecommunications network infrastructure, as illustrated in the figure. Another important dimension of effective telecommunications approaches lies in system and application security. For the system or solution to do its job over an extended period, it must include cyber and physical security arrangements to protect it from those that pose a threat. It is important that these security arrangements are \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial grade\xe2\x80\x9d using the best available technology from the wider world of Internet and commercial systems. Let us also not forget physical security as there is no point in having world class cyber security if the physical security is not up to par. Easy access to cabinets and equipment would enable bad actors to undermine cyber security arrangements.\n  It is an exciting time to be involved in the mobility industry. More data is available now than ever before, and new technologies have emerged that allow us to improve safety, while also achieving our other objectives. A well-structured, robust approach should be taken that considers all aspects of safety in an integrated approach making the best use of available technology. Initiatives should be results focused, never losing sight of the intended outcomes. While careful stewardship should be applied to expenditure, the human cost of poor safety along with the cost of property damage, should justify good levels of investment, to enable objectives to be achieved.\nNow that you know what can be done if you would like to know more about smarter, greener, and safer roadways?

The program helps machine builders and niche solution integrators to create repeatable, scalable, and reliable solutions with Cisco IoT technology embedded within.\nThe benefits of the Design-In Program include direct access to a range of IoT experts, inclusion in a joint marketing program, access to a unique support model, as well as participation in a commercial partnership framework. All these benefits are available throughout the solution lifecycle.\nLeading machine tool builder Yamazaki Mazak leveraged the Design-In program to accelerate and optimize the digital solutions offered to customers as part of the Mazak iConnect solution.\nMazak iConnect is a comprehensive service that connects customers, machine tools, and Mazak\xe2\x80\x99s support center with cloud network technology. It provides various support services such as remote diagnosis of equipment.\nHistorically, deploying machines to new customers was time consuming as the process required site visits to implement the customer specific configuration. The Cisco IoT solution enables remote, secure access to the onsite machines and customer specific configuration can be implemented remotely. Meaning Mazak can deploy this service at a large scale, quickly.\nThe chosen technical solution consists of a Cisco Catalyst IR1100 Rugged Series Routers with 4G connectivity, combined with Cisco IoT Operations Dashboard, a cloud-based management platform that enables Zero Touch onboarding of the remote IR1101 and subsequent provisioning of the required configuration template.

20,"Mining innovation: One access point, many solutions",Bruce Frederick,"b'Mining companies around the world have made great strides in digitalization. One of the most significant to date is the adoption of digital dispatch or Fleet Management Systems (FMS). This solution, which helps optimize truck routes, typically pays for itself in as little as four to six months on missed routes alone. Trucks burn through thousands of gallons of fuel daily. When haul trucks don\xe2\x80\x99t take the best route or go to the wrong location, the cost adds up quickly. Now, as mining enterprises pursue the next phase of digitalization, many are actively exploring two game-changing capabilities: tele-remote operations and autonomous vehicles, including autonomous haulage systems (AHS).\nWith tele-remote operations, mining companies can deploy one operator to oversee drilling and dozers across multiple sites or multiple drills and dozers at a single site. An operator works from the safety and comfort of an office \xe2\x80\x93 a significant advantage for finding and keeping talent. Meanwhile, the mining company avoids the risk and expense of sending human resources to what are often extremely remote and dangerous locations. These locations require major investments to provide even the most basic room and board for mining workers.\nAutonomous vehicles take humans out of the work altogether. These trucks run fully independently, \xe2\x80\x9cinteracting\xe2\x80\x9d with shovels and dozers to move materials safely and efficiently. In some cases, autonomous dozers can sense trucks and fill them; the trucks then transport the materials to the crusher, dump, or other location as required. Companies can trim the number of humans working in highly dangerous environments.\nBoth of these digital capabilities yield significant improvements in worker safety, operational efficiency, and long-term cost reductions. In addition, both require highly reliable and ruggedized wireless network connectivity.\nCatalyst IW9167 Heavy Duty Access Points will become available in 2023, enabling mining companies to begin implementing the infrastructure they need to reach new heights of digitalization and automation. Even better, they can implement new network infrastructure without a full shutdown to \xe2\x80\x9crip and replace\xe2\x80\x9d legacy gear.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s because the IW9167 is a single access point that supports two types of connectivity: WiFi 6E using 802.11ax standards or Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul mode. With this access point, mining companies can toggle between the two modes. They can support mobile users, connect IoT sensors, and handle other traffic via WiFi \xe2\x80\x93 while carving out highly secure, ultra-low-latency connectivity to support tele-remote and autonomous systems.\nIn addition to being certified by Caterpillar, the IW9167 makes it possible to incrementally build a more robust and reliable network in mining environments. This one device replaces multiple legacy products \xe2\x80\x93 including the IW3702 Workgroup Bridge, the Cisco FM 4500, the Cisco Aironet 1572, and any other 802.11 access points that may be in use.\nYou can migrate in phases \xe2\x80\x93 for example, install several IW9167 access points each month or quarter. In time, the network will be in place to support tele-remote operations and/or autonomous vehicles, with a single type of spare simplifying ongoing maintenance and support.\nAs your mining enterprise explores the next phase of digitalization, consider the elegance and versatility of the IW9167. Review more of the details in the following materials, and let\xe2\x80\x99s stay in touch as 2023 fast approaches.\n  Learn more\nCisco Catalyst IW9167 Series Product Overview\nCisco Catalyst IW9167E Heavy Duty Access Points At-a-Glance\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IW9167 Series Cisco Industrial Wireless Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul Featured Mining Open Pit & Underground Mining,"September 29, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/05/brfreder2.jpg-150x150.png

22,Managing the environmental impacts of European roadways and intersections,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\nThis is the second in a short series of blogs addressing the subjects: safer, smarter, and greener roadways.\nWhen I was growing up in Scotland, my grandmother would pass knowledge on to me in the form of proverbs. When I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting at a red traffic signal I remember one of her many sayings \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s fur ye, it\xe2\x80\x99ll nae gae past ye\xe2\x80\x9d, roughly translated as \xe2\x80\x9cif it\xe2\x80\x99s for you, it won\xe2\x80\x99t go past you.\xe2\x80\x9d No need to worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re green time will come. At traffic signals everybody loves a green light because it means \xe2\x80\x9cgo\xe2\x80\x9d. I believe that for the entire smart roadways movement, green should mean go, too. There is an important focus on being green. From a transport point of view, this means careful management of the unwanted side effects of the transport process, while maximizing the good things that we desire \xe2\x80\x93 safety, efficiency, and great customer experience. It is a challenge to go for green while also attaining the other goals. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, but it is absolutely possible with the right approach.\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoad transport constitutes the highest proportion of overall transport emissions (in 2019 it emitted 72% of all domestic and international transport GhG).\xe2\x80\x9d [1]\nWhat it means to be green\nFirst, let\xe2\x80\x99s define what it means to be green from a roadway point of view. The figure below captures the process that we need to follow. We can be greener by understanding challenges, developing appropriate responses, and implementing solutions that support responses.\nGreen has particular relevance for urban traffic signal control as every driver likes green traffic lights to keep going. More important is the ability to manage journeys through the road network in a way that optimizes traffic flow as it varies over the course of the day. Ideally, advanced traffic management will exactly align the green signal time with the traffic flow on each approach.\nGreenness for roadways\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s discuss an ideal, one-way journey as depicted in the figure below.\nThe pink line represents the planned or ideal journey, the red represents the actual journey. The nodes represent stage points in the journey. They could be timing points for a transit service, or modal interchanges for a traveler. They might also be major intersections along a limited access highway. For example, at point 2, the traveler might switch from local bus to commuter rail. You can see that at point 1, the journey is taking longer than planned. Time is made up between points 1 and 2, but lost again between points 3, 4 and 5.\nThere are two points that I would like to make here:\nFirst, the planned or ideal journey must be optimized for greenness: minimum carbon footprint, fuel consumption, and other factors that affect greenness. These include choosing the best mode of transport for the prevailing condition, matching the journey\xe2\x80\x99s purpose. It also includes managing those modes as effectively as possible, adapting to changes in the demand for transport and prevailing operating conditions. It is also essential to inform travelers about the choices they have for any journey, for any purpose, and at any time. These might be pre-planned, scheduled journeys, or spontaneous travel decisions. Mobility as a Service techniques can be used to inform the traveler, help them make a single reservation across the entire journey from origin to destination and support a single, convenient electronic payment for the travel services to be used.\nThe second point is that any deviation from the ideal or planned journey can be viewed as a \xe2\x80\x9closs of greenness.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case, the cumulative journey time increase (the red areas) could be caused by congestion or delay, reducing the journey greenness. This comparison of an ideal to actual journey is a technique used in aviation but typically not in surface transportation. In order to attain green, it will be necessary to have sufficient data collection and analytics capability to plan the optimum journey and monitor deviation from ideal during the actual journey. It will also be necessary to have the degree of situational awareness and management capability to improve the actual journey in formative, near real time ways. It is interesting to note that taking this approach to defining and measuring greenness also enables other factors to be optimized including safety, efficiency, user experience, and equity. Equity is improved by operating cost reductions making transport more accessible to all by reducing travel costs. We must go green and use management tools to stay green, for every stage of every journey.\nAchieving greenness\nThis is complicated and yes, as I said at the start, it is not easy, but it is entirely doable. It can be done by applying information and operational technologies such as those depicted in the figure below.\nThe operational technology is the part of the iceberg under water, unseen but irreplaceable. Information technology consists of various elements above the water, which deliver visible impacts but rely on the unseen operational technology. Together they support the range of customer facing applications that deliver greenness. Like the iceberg, I am focusing on just the tip of the greenness issue.\nTechnology can enable us to determine carbon impacts for different stages in the journey and all modes of transport. We can even look at the supply chains that deliver transport infrastructure and vehicles, ensuring that we optimize the bigger picture supporting circular economic approaches. Smart roadways and intersections are crucial elements in this due to the proportional impact that effective operations have on greenness. We can not only make our roadways greener, but also the entire transport system. From better intersection management to world-class high-speed highway operations, we have the tools available now to go green.\nGreen is for now\nSo why is it important for roadways to be greener now? We want to save the planet and reduce greenhouse gases (GhG)\xe2\x80\x94bold political goals have been set. Transport contributes a significant amount of GhG, especially road transport, so even a relatively small improvement would be significant. If we are to achieve these bold goals within the required time, then it\xe2\x80\x99s time to start planning and implementing. There are proven technology solutions that can be implemented off the shelf including advanced traffic management, electric cars and trucks, AI based decision support and advanced sensors. Robust, trusted OT networks can underpin the attainment of bold goals.\nGrandma\xe2\x80\x99s guide to greenness\nIn addition to her many sayings, my Grandmother would also give me sage advice. One piece of her advice was that to get what you want, there are two fundamental steps required. Step one is to decide what it is you want. Step two is to ask for it. We have obviously decided that we want greener roadways and transport. So now we have to ask for it by designing, specifying, and procuring it. It\xe2\x80\x99s still not easy being green, but it is now easier than ever due to bold political action and capable technologies. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go for green.\nLearn more\nWant to know more about smarter, greener, and safer roadways? Click here!\nVisit our booth #1246 at ITS World Congress on September 18-22, 2022.

23,Deliver next generation substation automation with the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router,Marcus Smith,"b'Substations are becoming more complex with greater demands placed on the network and connectivity. To address these challenges, our customers asked us to deliver a next-generation routing solution that builds upon our 10+ years of utility routing expertise \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve fulfilled that request with the new Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is much more than a new version of its predecessor, the Cisco 2010 Connected Grid Router. The Catalyst IR8340 is an all-new industrial routing platform that delivers powerful and versatile capabilities. It meets the substation needs of today and its modular upgradability will meet future needs with ease.\nBefore we dive deeper into how it can help you meet the increasing demands on your substation, let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss the background that led to this highly capable and unique platform.\nSubstation network operators are facing many challenges in the operational landscape. One of these is the increasing complexity of balancing the wide array of new power generation assets (such as solar and wind) with an equally complex consumption model (such as increase in electric vehicle charging). This real-time balancing act requires operators to connect more assets for increased visibility and control. Quite often it demands higher bandwidth with lower latency in a confined operational footprint.\nIn fact, many utilities require more capabilities in the same footprint of their networking infrastructure so they can reduce costs (rack space, power, cooling) and simplify the substation network complexity to aid troubleshooting.\nAs the utility grid becomes more automated, the reliance on the supporting communications network infrastructure becomes even more critical to the reliability and efficiency of the grid itself. This increase in grid digitization also enlarges the cyber security threat surface. Regulators and utilities strive for an ever-increasing security posture as many traditional substation security approaches come up short due to lack of asset visibility and centralized security policy enforcement.\nFinally, with this expansion of connected assets in the substation and the constant drive for operational efficiency, utilities are challenged on how to:\nDeploy networking equipment easily at scale and with centralized configuration control to reduce field visits.\nManage and operate these new networks through their lifecycle and ensure highest reliability.\nSecure the substation and provide asset reporting where required.\nTo solve these challenges, utilities are working toward full-scale grid modernization \xe2\x80\x94 including substation automation. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a matter of if but when and how they will upgrade.\nBased on more than a decade of global collaboration with the utility industry, we have developed solutions to digitize and automate substations including the new Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router.\nIt provides high performance routing (WAN, SDWAN), switching (substation LAN), security, timing, and edge compute, all from a single platform. It is specifically designed for the performance challenges of any substation automation architecture with a small footprint and ruggedized form factor (certified to IEC61850-3 and IEEE1613).\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is part of a new Cisco validated approach to substation automation and management. Together with the recently released Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches, the routers provide a validated architecture that unifies the substation LAN and WAN \xe2\x80\x93 adding the performance, security, scale, and management required for the modernization of the substation.\n5 essentials for the next-generation substation\nContinuing on from our previous blog, let\xe2\x80\x99s review the key points that address five critical capabilities for a modern substation with regards to the Catalyst IR8340:\nPerformance at scale. Utilities are asked to connect more assets at higher speed with more assets streaming more data (e.g., synchro phasors). The Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router provides 2 WAN ports and 12 LAN ports all within the same chassis with further modules supported to expand the WAN options. The Catalyst IR8340 has dramatically greater throughput at the WAN and LAN ports (tests have shown approx. 950Mbps for both LAN and WAN ports carrying mixed traffic) than its predecessor, the CGR2010. The router also provides routing and switching capabilities since it\xe2\x80\x99s a single integrated platform. In addition, the Catalyst IR8340 also delivers IP/MPLS support to the substation edge and supports Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s SDWAN solution as a ruggedized router.\nAsset visibility and cyber threat detection. Using the integrated edge compute capabilities of the Catalyst IR8340 as a security sensor, Cisco Cyber Vision enables utilities to gain an accurate, real-time view of their substation assets (visibility and vulnerabilities applicable) directly within the substation networks, especially when paired with Cisco Catalyst IE switches. This provides operations staff with East-West traffic visibility across the substation LAN, as well as North-South traffic visibility via the WAN to the control center. It also monitors network activity and flags anomalous behaviors that could indicate malicious activity\xe2\x80\x94all without any external sensors requiring dedicated SPAN port traffic connections.\nEnterprise-grade management and automation. Substation operators are increasingly managing their substations as scaled IT assets, utilizing the deep knowledge and capabilities of Cisco\xe2\x80\x99s industry-leading network security and management tools. The Catalyst IR8340 runs Cisco IOS-XE and builds upon this using Cisco DNA Center for automation, assurance, and compliance, as well as leveraging Cisco security features such as TrustSec, MACsec, 802.1x, VRF, VLAN, and Flexible NetFlow to the substation LAN via the built-in switching ports. As a Catalyst router it also delivers Cisco SD-WAN to the substation, so you can securely simplify deployment and management, as well as save costs by configuring SD-WAN to select the most relevant data transport path for different types of traffic.\nSupport for industry standard protocols. The Catalyst IR8340 supports many protocols relevant to the substation, including IEC62439-3 PRP & HSR for redundancy (the Catalyst IR8340 is acting as a PRP RedBox or HSR DANH), Cisco REP for ring topologies and multiple spanning tree variants. The timing module provides a direct GNSS connection and provides IEEE1588 PTP timing as a Grandmaster for the substation LAN, supporting C37.238 power profile and IEC61850-9-3 PUP. It supports widely used substation protocols such as IEC61850 (Layer 2 GOOSE, SV and layer 3 MMS), IEC104, DNP3, and Modbus, that are essential to substation operations. The Catalyst IR8340 natively supports serial connections via the serial interface module to provide either protocol translation (IEC101 to 104 and Serial DNP3 to DNP3 over IP) or tunneling of serial data across the network (using TCP/UDP Raw Sockets feature) allowing customers to support legacy serial assets while migrating to ethernet enabled devices. The Catalyst IR8340 also provides support for T1/E1 WAN connections via a network module for integration into existing SONET/SDH transport environments to ease the move to IP based technologies.\nApplication hosting and edge compute. Substation operators are looking for ways to run applications locally in their space-constrained substation rugged environments. The Catalyst IR8340 is designed with this need in mind and with support for Cisco IOx to power Cisco Cyber Vision and the utility\xe2\x80\x99s own applications within the substation. Examples include virtual RTUs, security applications, and many more.\nAdvantages of using the Catalyst IR8340 for next generation substation automation\nThe Catalyst IR8340 has something to offer for both IT and OT teams, with powerful automation tools available to suit either.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 is a key component being validated as an integral part of the new Cisco Substation Automation validated Designs.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 provides connectivity and flexibility for now and the future with 4 expansion slots, so you can add 5G, P-LTE, FirstNet, 450Mhz, and future connectivity technologies, or additional storage or compute whenever it is needed. You will also have 4 copper, 4 combo, 4 SFP LAN ports, and 2 combo WAN ports at the ready.\nThe Catalyst IR8340 condenses multiple traditionally separate components into a single platform: WAN router, LAN switching with PRP/HSR/REP support, PTP Timing, and Security (Zone Based firewall, Cisco Cyber Vision Sensor).\nAnd it fits into the same rack space as the CGR2010!\nSo, for your next substation automation project, consider the Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router and its flexible feature rich capabilities. You can start with simple use cases for secure connectivity and enable additional capabilities as your operational requirements evolve (e.g., enabling the Cisco Cyber Vision sensor, adding substation timing by adding the Timing Module or adding private or public cellular support via the range of 4G/5G Modules).\nLearn more\nCisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router Datasheet\nCisco.com/go/ir8300\nKeep up with the latest Internet of Things trends and\ninsights to help you succeed with your IoT deployments.\nSubscribe to our Cisco IoT Newsletter\n  Share'",Tags: Cisco Catalyst IE9300 Rugged Series Switches Cisco Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Router Cisco Catalyst IR8340 Rugged Router Cisco Cyber Vision Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches Cisco Industrial Routers Cisco Industrial Security Critical Infrastructure Utilities,"September 6, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/01/IL20220124192807-Marcus-Smith-150x150.jpg

25,Is it time to prod your roadways with a stick?,Bob McQueen,"b'We are thrilled to have Bob McQueen, from Bob McQueen & Associates as a guest blogger on our channel. Bob is an internationally recognized expert in smart mobility and Intelligent Transport Systems. He has over 40 years of experience in helping public and private sector clients to get the best results from advanced transport technology, working in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Clients include leading technology companies such as LG, Samsung, Rockwell Collins and Egis Transportation Systems.\nThis is the first in a short series of blogs addressing the subjects: safer, smarter, and greener roadways. In this blog, I address \xe2\x80\x9csmarter\xe2\x80\x9d. We will take a look at the definition and discuss several aspects of smart roadways.\n  Listen to a narration of the blog on YouTube.\n  How do you know if your roadway is smart?\nIt is quite simple, prod it with a stick and see what happens! While this is a humorous approach, there is an underlying message.\nIf the roadway is smart, it will detect the prod and react appropriately. This implies that the roadway has both sensing capabilities and intelligence. Of course, the roadway doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make the decision itself, the sensing data needs to be sent back to the \xe2\x80\x9cbrain\xe2\x80\x9d or the traffic management center where an appropriate response can be defined. This gives an initial understanding of what a smart roadway is: sensors, high-speed telecommunications, decision-making, and command-and-control. But it is more than just technology elements.\nInteractive\nAs we apply technology elements, the roadway evolves from a passive resource into an interactive component of a framework that includes roadway, vehicle, driver, and management systems. It takes its place as a vital, active part of a systematic approach to traffic and mobility management. This is the first part of how I define \xe2\x80\x9csmart roadways\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the ability to be interactive.\nDisproportionate impact\nThe next part relates to the effects that smart roadways manifest. The obvious effects are improved safety, increased efficiency, enhanced user experience, minimized environmental effects, and improved equity. A less obvious and yet inherent quality of the operational technologies used in smart roadways is what we would call the \xe2\x80\x9cSun Tzu\xe2\x80\x9d effect. General Tzu was a famous Chinese general who lived around 500 BC. His book on military strategy, The Art of War, has been influencing military and strategic thinking ever since. In his book he said, \xe2\x80\x9csmall forces can achieve great things.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen you apply a small force at the right time, amazing effects can happen. The small force in this case is advanced transport technology in the form of Operational Technology or sharp end Information Technology designed to support real time traffic management.\nAnnual spending in Europe on advanced transport technology is about 5% of what is spent on asphalt, concrete, and steel. Yet the results significantly influence the performance of the conventional infrastructure. It is time to apply more \xe2\x80\x9csmall force\xe2\x80\x9d to get bigger results. Political goals have been set with respect to greenhouse gases and road traffic fatality reductions. These goals are not going to be attained with just asphalt, concrete, or steel. We need to add new infrastructure in form of operational technology, commonly referred to as a network.\nThese days, when we refer to roadway infrastructure, we are actually talking about two different things working in harmony, as a single system \xe2\x80\x93 the roadway infrastructure and the operational technology infrastructure. The small, new forces of operational technology will become critical to the successful operation of our transport network.\nShowing the signs of age\nThis brings us to another reason why the time is ripe for action. Much of the current operational technology network for traffic is aging. Not just in terms of hardware and software, but in terms of outdated architectures for connectivity and cybersecurity. Can you rely on it or is your network living on borrowed time? Being smart is also about being current.\nThe essence of smart roadways\nSo, if your roadway is smart then it will react appropriately when you prod it with a stick. It will have the sensing capabilities to detect threats and opportunities. It will also deliver the intelligence required to determine the appropriate response and timing of that response. Smart also includes the capability of the roadway to go beyond passive into a proactive, interactive component in a bigger system. And finally, smart embodies an inherent ability to do more with less. However, the most significant part of being smart lies in what you do with it. It is now time for us to harness the full power of smart roadways to help us to attain both our greenhouse gas and safety goals.\nSo, ask yourself this: Are your roadways and intersections smart enough for the road ahead? Is it time to consider an upgrade to operational technology and infrastructure?

The primary function of the iDMZ is the enforcement of a secure boundary between the internal trusted operations environment and external entities that may need to exchange data with services that support the operation.\nOne of the challenges with an exclusively on-site iDMZ is the limited ability around expansion to meet future demand and capabilities. With the growth of Industrial IoT (IIoT), it will be necessary for hardware and resource growth to meet the demands of increasing data. This translates to a consistently increasing hardware footprint and utilities to provide cooling and power, which can be in limited supply on premises. In addition, operators must explore new ways to obtain deeper insights and introduce enhancements to the operation, which may require tighter alignment with partners and/or the ability to securely consume XaaS offers.\nOperators also have a safety-first culture, keeping people out of the \xe2\x80\x9cline of fire.\xe2\x80\x9d Vendors and partners may need to maintain on-site hardware, applications and services, potentially exposing people to risk through their presence on-site. For heavy industry environments, accessibility to site and the equipment residing on it is not necessarily an easily accomplished task. Many industrial sites require site safety training and approved work permits as a prerequisite for physical access.\nFinally, a lack of iDMZ consistency when comparing multiple sites, from a hardware and feature composition, creates challenges for operations staff. In some instances, product and feature selection is made locally. This impacts the ability to deliver consistent policies and end user experiences. It also complicates support across the operation for staff responsible for troubleshooting and minimizing time to resolution and maintaining different SOPs and training documents.\nOperators exploring options to gain operational efficiencies through modern service offerings may benefit from exploring how to extend their iDMZ beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cfour walls\xe2\x80\x9d of the operation.\nOne deployment alternative for iDMZ is extending the architecture to leverage a hybrid-cloud model. A hybrid cloud iDMZ model can be deployed as a centralized model or repeated regionally, based on geographic presence and/or regulatory or compliance requirements. While migrating the entirety of the iDMZ and its capabilities to the cloud may not be an option, a hybrid cloud iDMZ architecture does offer operational benefits and mitigates previously raised challenges.\nFirst, the hybrid cloud iDMZ can secure the operation, and mitigate risk and exposure. Similar to an on-prem iDMZ, multiple tools and applications should be leveraged to take a holistic approach for enforcing security. This can include:\nServices that support a secure and encrypted pipe between an operations site and a regional iDMZ\nSegmentation and possible options for multi-tenancy\nVisibility to monitor applications and flows traversing the industrial zone\nThe solution should also include tools for consistently configuring, deploying, enforcing policies, and managing assets.\nIn addition to providing a holistic security strategy, a hybrid cloud iDMZ offers the benefit of shared resources and assets, as opposed to entirely duplicating unique stand-alone iDMZ deployments per site. The regional based approach offers a more repeatable and consistent architecture, delivering consistent policies, as well as easing the operational overhead and complexity mentioned previously.\nA hybrid cloud solution offers more flexibility to expand, and contract based on evolving requirements and demand. By leveraging public cloud services as part of the iDMZ architecture, operators have the ability to increase capabilities without physically maintaining hardware and space to house equipment. This approach affords the unique opportunity to foster tighter engagements with partners and ecosystem vendors, while leveraging cloud services to drive innovation, deeper operational insights and efficiencies. Adding tools like Thousand Eyes and App Dynamics, operators can verify adherence to application SLAs/SLOs, in accordance with operational requirements.\nFinally, a hybrid cloud iDMZ aligns with the concept of the ROC (Regional Operations Center), which is top of mind for some industrial organizations, especially those with a global footprint. A ROC model seeks to leverage more automation and remote operations, thus reducing on-site headcount to mission essential resources, improving on-site safety and driving more operational efficiencies. With a regional based iDMZ deployment, the process of aggregating and presenting the status and data for operations within the region can become more streamlined and a regionally distributed model can facilitate compliance with local industry regulations, if applicable.\nFor more details on how to build a hybrid cloud iDMZ architecture and its benefits for securing industrial operations, we have just published a short white paper that you should read on the Hybrid Cloud Industrial DMZ. We\xe2\x80\x99ll also be discussing this in a free webinar on September 20, 2022.\nWatch the webinar replay Hybrid Cloud iDMZ.\nTo learn more about how you can secure your industrial infrastructure, visit our industrial security page or contact us to have a conversation around your industrial IoT security challenges.\nWant the latest industry news on IoT security delivered straight to your inbox?\nSubscribe to the Cisco IoT/OT Security Newsletter\nShare'",Tags: Cisco Industrial Security Cisco Secure Firewall firewall management Industrial IoT (IIoT) Manufacturing Mining network security Oil and Gas,"August 23, 2022",https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2022/06/Kevin-Turek-150x150.png
